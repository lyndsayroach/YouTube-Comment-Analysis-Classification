Y-ZaFDWyZ38,😂🎉 good,FoxNews
Y-ZaFDWyZ38,"The only thing you need to know about a guy who retired as a Lt. Colonel is that he wasn't even good enough to get promoted to a full Colonel. I'm appalled at how little Americans know or care about Russia and China. China is on the edge of economic collapse with youth unemployment at 45% and what remains of their economy is totally dependent on trade with the West. They aren't going to be helping Russia in any other than the sneaky minor ways they usually operate. Russia is a rival and only occasionally a friend of convenience. Russia is turning to North Korea for help and not China. Oh, and the Opium War was with Britain and not America. This is the only time I've ever hoped the Dems win the election because the Republicans have their heads firmly planted up their butts about Ukraine.",FoxNews
Y-ZaFDWyZ38,I am lost as to why your commentator considers Trump is an answer as was it not Trump who gave the nod to Putin to go ahead with this war? Trump who envied dictators like Putin and Chi and Trump who Putin ridiculed behind his back for his infantile use of language?,FoxNews

Y-ZaFDWyZ38,"Rubbish BS.
If you say Russians carried out forced mobilizations tell us the type of mobilization ukrainians carried out. Ukrainians were forcing people of the street to the war front.
You are talking nonsense.",FoxNews
Y-ZaFDWyZ38,"Ukraine has breached the surovikin line which was Russias strongest defensive fortifications & better troops, they are working on the second line now and have one more after that.  Even when Ukraine reaches the Sea of Astov and they break the Crimea land bridge, and that probably won’t happen before the Rasputitsa mud & winter hit, this war will be far from over, 1-3 years.  If Biden wouldn’t have meekly tiptoed around Putin unnecessarily  delaying the transfer of armor for months Russia would not have been able to build these massive minefields & defensive lines, he has needlessly prolonged this war far longer than needed and it’s just a colossal waste of life on both sides and for nothing.",FoxNews

Y-ZaFDWyZ38,"I don't like Cavuto  and this guest is  echoing his politics. Biden  has sold us out  to make money for him and his family in China, Ukraine and anywhere else he can make a buck. I'd rather vote for  anybody  that will stop illegal migration and stop spending money on Ukraine",FoxNews

That's not how you convince countries that the West has been pillaging, overthrowing and controlling for centuries. It seems, objectively, that it's only the collective west that thinks Russia is evil. 
So many countries are de-dollarising and breaking away from their neocolonial western masters.... That's why they label this alternative set of systems and structures as 'evil'. The US Empire is in decline and they don't like it despite bringing it upon themselves.",FoxNews
Y-ZaFDWyZ38,"I think it's best of both parties interests to reach an immediate CEASEFIRE. Ukraine didn't start this war. Nor they were well prepared. Russia drove them to do desperate measures. Now the fire of war reached to Russia. Tit for tat!

The loss on both side is enormous. And just because Russia is more powerful or bigger, doesn't mean it has to flex its muscle.

Lets have an immediate Ceasefire and withdrawal of troops from Ukraine. And if Ukraine doesn't listen then Russia can continue.

4. Recently, the head of the office of the NATO Secretary General, Stian Jenssen, received a scolding after he commented on possible options for ending the conflict in Ukraine that did not provide for the complete defeat of Russia.

And bring the rest of our military home as well and station it in and around the U.S. and its territories. We need to start hunkering down. China already has thousands of operatives in our country, which include soldiers of the cartels.

l7C7vNa2-K0,"There are 5 different reasons why it is imperative for the US to support Ukraine
1. Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 when they seized Crimea was clearly unjustified and who better to stand against an unjustified invasion by Russia than the US and it’s allies?
2. A peaceful and stable Europe is important to the entire world, especially to the US and it’s geopolitical allies.
3. In 1994 we signed 3 different agreements called the Budapest Memorandum that had 4 countries, Ukraine, the US, the UK, and Russia, where it was agreed that Ukraine would give up all the nuclear weapons in their stockpile back to Russia in exchange for their independence, sovereignty, and current borders to be respected by Russia, the US, and the UK. Additionally, all parties agreed to refrain from the threat or use of force towards Ukraine, refrain from using economic coercion designed to subordinate Ukraine’s interests, and that they would seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine if Ukraine should be a victim to an act of aggression. 
https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%203007/Part/volume-3007-I-52241.pdf
4. If we allow Russia to invade Ukraine and keep their territory we are sending a message to the rest of the world that unless you are either a part of NATO, in an alliance with Russia or China, or acquired nuclear weapons on your own, you’re not safe from being invaded. For the purposes of preventing nuclear proliferation it’s important to prevent other countries from thinking that they’re going to be invaded and conquered if they don’t have nuclear weapons on their own.
5. A victory for Russia here would embolden Russia and China in future territorial conquest, so it’s important to shut down that idea right now and show the world that the rest of the world will stand against those type of activities.",CNN

l7C7vNa2-K0,"This liberal-fascist propaganda material is quite frivolous - of course it can be used for brainwashing. But it has little to do with reality. Ukraine actually has no chance, it would have collapsed a long time ago if money did not flow from the EU and the USA, but these subsidies do not last indefinitely. The EU's economy has already become a shambles, the US petrodollar is also approaching the end game - that's why there is this all-or-nothing game, because the end threatens the USA much more than Russia, where 18 million km2 of natural resources, energy, agricultural land is available, in practically inexhaustible quantities. While Ukraine's manpower has already dwindled significantly, perhaps more than half of the country's population has already fled, and most of those who can be drafted into the army are recruited from inexperienced people, who have never seen a weapon or war, who do not want to go to war at all, and who should suddenly become familiar with the weapons systems of countless different nationalities. and that they can use it meaningfully. Basically, this is all a failed attempt! The war could be over a long time ago, but basically this is US interest, just as provoking the war was also US interest, the others are just puppets in the shop window. The USA wants to weaken Europe into servile serfdom and cut off its middle class, as well as to separate Europe's economy from Russian energy and mineral resources, because if Europe and Russia had become more intertwined, then the USA would have had a competitor in addition to China , which would have been difficult to cope with. The USA is on a forced path because of the depreciating dollar and because of the financial banking system, which is slowly living from today to tomorrow, they are only postponing the time of the great collapse with financial injections, but they know that it is inevitable and cannot be sustained indefinitely. That's why they created a war crisis and videos like this are part of this war propaganda - you can only laugh! Ukraine has a zero chance against Russia. At a certain point, the living force simply runs out, no matter how many billions of dollars or euros anyone prints, no matter how many thousands of tanks and weapons anyone delivers, no one will use it meaningfully and that's the end! The fighting morale has long since ended, practically the USA is only slaughtering the Ukrainian youth and now the older ones for its desperate selfish goals.",CNN

With experience serving in the US contingent in Afghanistan, Magallon was employed by Ukrainian troops in March 2022. He gained fame as one of the perpetrators of the murder of Russian soldiers in the village of Petropavlovka, Kharkiv region, on September 27, 2022.
That day around 20 mercenaries managed to surround four Russian soldiers, but their numerical advantage was balanced by their worse training. The mercenaries got out of the draw by suggesting to negotiate and killing the Russian negotiator.

Coverage of the Ukraine, Russian War is the same! They don't show you body's and death, actual combat as it's taking place or the massive amounts of land that has been destroyed and grabbed by Russia! 

People need to see the death and destruction! Why? Because people have been coddled, and protected from the extreme physical harm we can cause to property and human life! We do this to entertain the notion that there's an honor or sacredness to war...that must be kept from the general public, less they become too desensitized to the blood that is spilled or that it will awaken in all of us a blood lust for violence!

You may entertain any part of that to feed your continued narrative or delusion! But in my opinion, people need to see all of it...the blood, the guts, the destruction, the bravery and the stupidity! Why? So we can no longer hide from the sobering truth that war costs...😠!

Since the AFU has no air cover, it will need a ten to one advantage. Right now, both armies are numerically the same though most of the AFU's experienced veterans are dead or disabled and their ranks were replaced by people snatched off the streets by press gangs. What the Zelenskiy gang is doing is killing enough of their own troops, in suicidal attacks, to keep the Western money flowing. If he tries a real and serious offensive, he won't have enough army left to repel a Russian counterattack in another place.

l7C7vNa2-K0,"1st September 2023. 

Why would anyone be disappointed with Ukraines offensive? 

To all those who think Ukraines offensive is failing, your idea of success, is probably based on Ukraines previous routs of Russia in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts, and that is an unrealistic expectations! This is not a Hollywood movie and Ukraine are facing the, reputedly, 2nd biggest military in the world who had 12 months to prepare! 🤔 .

In 12 weeks, Ukraine has liberated 593sq miles of Russian temporarily occupied lands, through battle zones with well prepared defences.

 In comparison to Russia, supported by the entire might of the 2nd biggest military in the world taking 10 months, yes 10 months, to capture just 144sq km around Bakhmut.

Ukraine has broken through the 1st and 2nd lines of defence, breached the Surovikin lines and are now behind Russias defences inside Russias trenches. 

Let's not forget that Russias mighty Black Sea fleet has to stay in the far east of the Black Sea, scared to come within 600km of Ukraines coast. Forced out of Russias regional navy stronghold Savastapol and the Azov Sea by Ukraines actions. All that by a country that doesn't even have a navy! 

Let's no forget that Ukraines airspace is a ""no fly zone"" for Russias airforce, who can't come within 15km of Ukraines borders or cities for fear of being shot down and are relying on unmanned drones to do their work with decreasing success and at the same time Russia is losing 12 aircraft a week in airbases all across Russia and hundreds of miles from Ukraine. 

Let's not forget that Russia has evacuated hundreds of thousands of Russians, both civilians and senior officers, from Crimea scared of Ukraines capabilities and a Storm Shadow visit or two, to Crimea and the Kerch Bridge.

- Ukraine is mobilizing all Ukrainians, including the underaged. 

- The collective West is tired and disappointed in Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians are ready to give up territories in exchange for “peace”. 

- Ukrainian counteroffensive failed. The losses are catastrophic. Russians plan to amplify the number of deaths in specific regions of Ukraine. 

- The Ukrainian government is corrupt, and no one is getting punished for corruption. 

- Ukraine is purposefully losing Kupiansk 

- Life is great on the Russia-occupied territories. Pensions are high. Everything is getting rebuilt.",CNN

l7C7vNa2-K0,"Up to now, I am not sure why the Ukrainians can't punch a hole through the dragon's teeth defensive line.  These are concrete structures designed to hinder the advance of the armour vehicles.  In principle there are sophisticated weapons that can fired at these structures and blow them apart, or even have aircraft launch laser guided high explosive bombs.  Or launch a massive artillery strike at these structures to blow them apart.   They can patch up any big holes they make when they puncture holes in the defensive line , via night operations, and once that's done, move in quickly with bradley's and M1's.  

prior to punching through the hole formed in the defensive line, they can launch massive cluster bomb attacks at russian artillery sites to suppress their incoming fire.  

Once the Ukrainians can punch through the lines and cut the Russian held occupied territory  in half, the war would be over very quickly.",CNN

l7C7vNa2-K0,"The lies will soon be exposed in this war. No man can cover up the truth, for the truth shall set you free. Ukraine is not only losing this war but over 300,000 Ukrainian men and women have been killed with over 50,000 amputees. You’re leaders your local politicians, the newscast who are essentially FBI paid actors. They put out whatever narrative they want you to believe.  But soon the truth shall be exposed.",CNN
l7C7vNa2-K0,"Too many people in these commits are treating this as if it is a game. 
Let me make something clear, if 'you...' say and spread disinformation that undermines the brave people's of Ukraine's fight, don't think you are not doing any harm... you are, and will be contributing towards people being killed. It isn't a game, these are people's lives... grow up!",CNN
l7C7vNa2-K0,"What part of Russia is a ""dictatorship"" do too many people not understand? 'Dictatorships...' don't even allow their own people to speak out, or know the truth!

So why on earth would think for a moment they would tell ""you"" the truth?
	
If a Russian person even calls this a 'war...' they can face upwards of ""10 years"" or more in jail, or worse be murdered by the regime. Putin has said this 'war...' has to be called a ""special military operation.""

Russian soldiers are brutalised, lied to and tortured by their own government. The families how lose loved ones, few get the death payments promised them, and soldiers themselves are left often with no pay or weapons with substandard equipment, which left many to freeze to death in winter. 

There are no free fair elections in Russia under Putin - all free media and political opposition has been shut down, journalists, politicians and ordinary people - imprisoned or murdered!

Many have been taken in by Russian disinformation: by the way it was Russia under Stalin and the KGB in 1923 which arrived at the concept and coined the word 'disinformation!' They even gave it a Western sounding name, so we would more easily adopt it... so that worked?

Putin has murdered ""100 000s"" of people in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine and elsewhere in the world.

Syria, was a people's uprising as a result of the Arab Spring, which began in Tunisia in 2010, as a result Assad slaughtered peaceful protesters with gunships. The people fought bravely for years, but when Damascus was about to fall, Assad called in Putin. Assad and Putin then murdered ""100 000s"" of people, dropping bombs on children in their schools, burning them alive! 

In Russia itself, if people even call the Ukraine Russia War, a ""war..."" they can face up to ""10 years"" in jail, or if someone is a high profile politician or public figure, then can be imprisoned or even murdered. 

A recent UN stated the in a terror campaign orchestrated by Putin... ""children""  as young as '4' years old are being tortured and raped. 

We must act to stop this, and support the people of Ukraine to ensure this ends... in defeating the Putin Regime this could be a turning corner for humanity, in our search to end war, and all injustice?",CNN

l7C7vNa2-K0,I lived in Berdyansk for some months.  The roads were abysmal.  I doubt seriously that the Russians are doing any maintenance on the roads.  They don't have enough trucks to keep all their troops supplied over the East-West highway running from Mariupol to Melitopol and then south to Chongar or Armiansk.  The Russians are rail dependent for logistics.  Trucks just run the last lap.  The main East-West rail line runs through Tokmak to Melitopol with a substantial spur line running to the Port of Berdyansk.  The Ukrainians won't have to advance too much further to place the rail line under fire control.  Once they get far enough to place the highway under fire control things will start changing rapidly.

The beginning of autumn brought with it terrible consequences for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It became known that Russian intelligence managed to pull off a brilliant operation to detect and destroy the officers not only of the Ukrainian army but also of representatives of Western countries. So it turned out that for several months Russian intelligence had been tracking the accumulation of high-ranking officers of the enemy army overseeing the fighting in the Donetsk direction.

l7C7vNa2-K0,">>> Something to consider, China's plans for a Russian slave/puppet state: With the current Ukraine situation, the fact is that Putin can't fight a war on two fronts and survive. Putin and China's Xi put up a public front in 2018 that they have some type of ""mutual"" military defense ""pact"" against ""the west"", their CRMC agreement, but that may not really exist. Putin's China ""tell"" was the Russian Vostok-2018 military exercises with a claimed 330,000 Russian troops on the Chinese border and only 3,300 Chinese troops inside China (never closer than 150km). Putin's not so covert saber rattling at the Chinese. Putin knows China wants/needs all the natural resources of Siberia and Central Asia along its border (including Kazakhstan and Vladivostok). Since Russia has invaded Ukraine, Putin is leaving ""eastern/Asian"" Russia defenseless against the ramping up of the Chinese military. China is going to eventually ""recover/reclaim"" central Asia and Siberia north of Mongolia and east of the Ob/Irtysh and Yenisei Rivers (the natural dividing line between eastern Europe and central Asia). When Putin/Russia is weak, China will invade, cut eastward supply lines coming out of ""Slavic Russia"", and ""protect"" Eastern Russia from ""western aggression"", aka, take all of the Asiatic lands westward all the way to ""Slavic"" Russia, without a Russian defense. AKA, China is going to gnaw off Russia's hind legs and Russia will be helpless to stop it. The smiling/hungry Chinese cat is eyeballing the tasty fluttering Russian canary. Just saying...

l7C7vNa2-K0,"Well that might be a trap. I mean letting Ukrainians into through that dragons teeth then the Ukrainians need to fight between those three  tranches. I also think that Russians deliberately withdraw from that Southern Robotyne to make  Ukrainians fight two sides in both sides and third side Ukrainians need fight between two sides of the tranche but it might be possible they can break through there.
That is why I have been saying Ukrainians need to have full stability of Robotyne too cut off those supply lines through their longer range missiles. 

But overall Ukrainians have creak Russians line and they have definitely put pressure on all sides because Russians have to put their best troops there to stabilised those line which means sooner or later there will holes everywhere, so congratulations to Ukrainians.

The only way out it is that Russians need to open a new front to stretch Ukrainians inorder for them to retaken lost land, Ukrainians will then need to send troops to counter that attack which means it will create insatiablity in Ukrainians attack and to create balance, the other way is Russians have bomb that one way in highway to stop supply coming in.",CNN

l7C7vNa2-K0,"Don't underestimate the RUS solid defense in Robotin. Ukrainian strategy is to sacrify its 9 bridges inckuding 2 battalions of the  foreign mercenaries  in the mine fields to make road for its 2 best nato-trained, fully equipped 82nd air calvary and 46th armored brigades. They punched thru the defenses while the RUS airbones were ordered to reposition to avoid casualties. 2 UKR advancing brigades took Robotino without any significant casualty (48K,125W). They fanned out around Robotino to condolidate their control. However, right now, these 2 best UKR brigades of 4,800 men are encircled in the town by RUS counterattacks from the southern flank punching thru a western front to isolate any supply into town while the RUS AA troops hold the northern and move southwest to block all the UKR withdrawal paths.  RUS top field commaders want the nuclear tactical strikes to end any hope of UKR suicidal move to the Azov seaports. Kiev is wide open as the Nato troops are standing by in Poland border to come in UKR with a reason of evacuating their dip. corps.  RUS has been repeating warning of a direct confrontation with the nato if the nato is in UKR for any reason without RUS advanced knowledge and agreement. That is the main reason why Putin has signed his author to deploy a new Sarmat regiment to be ready for the full nuclear war with the West led by the U.S. 
A better news for UKR that its single UAV attack has destroyed RUS famed BUK M3 central nerve control system. RUS has to replace the new BUK-M3 nerve control from Kuril island  in the far east overnight. The Moscow vicinity has been facing the increasing UAV attacks each day, around the clock while traffic to Crimea is closed.

Ukraine's counteroffensive is dragging on? Why? When are you going to put an end to the  stalemate?

l7C7vNa2-K0,"That's what happens when nato fails to make quick decisions. Russia amplifies the nuclear threat. 141 countries have the ability to end that threat altogether by turning their weapons towards russia and stopping the russian population from being able to enter their countries. It's geared to escalate to a breaking point before it is completely stopped by the russian people themselves. Set up defense systems over russia and point the finger back. That's what it's coming to, putin can't use nuclear weapons he knows it. When russia is under threat that's when putin is under threat. Theres no other player on the world map willing to escalate for russia because they all know what happens to putin happens to them if they try. They understand it's a baseless war for profit. The sooner we get around to it the sooner this war ends. That's the trajectory this war is on and its almost inevitable. Ideally before brics can fully form. Travel bans from the top down especially will make for a very bad day for putin. When they become prisoners of the state including the gru and svr, the next guy in line will freeze under pressure.

l7C7vNa2-K0,"So, whence goes the war from here? Well, the obvious question to ask is whether we believe Ukraine will ever have a more potent assault package than the one they started the summer with. The answer clearly seems to be no. It was like pulling teeth to scrape together these understrength brigades - the idea that, following on a defeat in the Battle of Zaporizhia, NATO will somehow put together a more powerful package seems like a stretch. More to the point, we have American officials saying fairly explicitly that this was the best mechanized package Ukraine was going to get.
It does not seem controversial to say that this was Ukraine’s best shot at some sort of genuine operational victory, which at this point seems to be slowly trickling away into modest but materially costly tactical advances. The ultimate implication of this is that Ukraine is unable to escape a war of industrial attrition, which is precisely the sort of war that it cannot win, due to all the asymmetries that we mentioned earlier.

In particular, however, Ukraine cannot win a positional-attritional war because of its own maximalist definition of “winning.” Since Kiev has insisted that it will not give up until it returns its 1991 borders, an inability to dislodge Russian forces poses a particularly nasty problem - Kiev will either need to admit defeat and acknowledge Russian control over the annexed areas, or it will continue to fight obstinately until it is a failed state with nothing left in the tank.

Trapped in a bat fight, with attempts to unlock the front with maneuver coming to naught, what Ukraine needs most is a much bigger bat. The alternative is a totalizing strategic disaster.

Pushed by the U.S. the Ukrainian leadership seems to have decided to go for the alternative.",CNN

The terrorists who took over the country decided to hold their own fake elections. The countries of the EU and the US benefit from such terrorists, because they agreed to be an aggressor against Russia, but in return the US and the EU turned a blind eye to the fact that they are illegitimate.
It turns out that we have a fake illegitimate country ""Ukraine"" in the power of which the terrorists, but everyone pretends that this is normal.

In 2014, there was a military seizure of power, armed militants seized power in Ukraine and forced the current government to flee the country.
These militants declared themselves the main ones in the country.
Since then, since 2014, militants have been ruling on the territory of “Ukraine”.
Having gained access to the state army, these militants unleashed a war with Russia.
There is no need to recognize the terrorists of Ukraine as if they are the government, they are not, these are war criminals who have seized the country by armed seizure.
For 9 years now, terrorists in the power of Ukraine have been waging a military conflict with Russia for the money of Western countries that have agreed to sponsor them. It is not normal.
Understand that Ukraine is not a state since 2014, it is a territory ruled by terrorists and neo-fascists.

I am a European, a former officer of a NATO partner country. It is not for me to interfere in the internal affairs of the United States. I don't intend to do that either. That is the sole responsibility of the citizens of the United States.
The Americans have excellent experts on the subject of Ukraine. However, more than 40% of U.S. citizens do not listen to these experts, or are intellectually unable to understand the seriousness of the situation and its consequences. So I have to speak up to show Americans – beyond the media – a different point of view.
I hope that the American people will understand that the Biden administration made a historic mistake when it decided to start an open war with the Russian Federation in Ukraine. Ukraine has long ceased to be about freedom and democracy. It is about the establishment of an autocratic regime that tramples on freedom itself and is built on corruption and oppression of dissenters.  
The establishment of an oligarchy that is only intended to satisfy the greed for profit and the assertion of nationalist interests, small circles on both sides of the pond. We, the European and US citizens, are financing in Ukraine the realization of the dreams of the German leader and Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler. The dream of ""conquering Lebensraum in the East""!  
Hitler and Goebbels toast each other in hell and laugh at each other in the face of our stupidity. Because what is happening in Ukraine right now is the creation and provision of living space for the ""Germanic race"" (that's how they see themselves again). Listen carefully to today's self-proclaimed elite of the Germans. Explicitly, I mean here the Green Party and its flagship Baerbock.
In front of the assembled parliamentarians of the EU, the German Foreign Minister declared: ""We are fighting a war against Russia!"" Without this having had any consequences. No, we Europeans are not waging this war, the Germans against the Russian Federation! We also do not want to wage war against the Russians. 
For more than 30 years, since communism came to an end, I have seen two dangers for our Western civilization (shaped by Christianity, antiquity and humanism). This is political Islam (which can't really be dangerous to us). But this is above all Han Chinese nationalism. A nationalism (independent of communism and the Chinese Communist Party) that bears all the disgusting traits of German National Socialism during the Third Reich. This is one of the reasons why the Germans and the Chinese get along so well.
This Han Chinese nationalism was, in my eyes (before the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict), the factor that really threatens world peace. Because this Han Chinese nationalism will leave us only two options. Either we submit – submission is out of the question for me. Or we show the Han Chinese that – in the event of a military confrontation – they cannot win, cannot profit.
This opportunity to show the Han Chinese that they are not the masters of the world. The stupidity of the Biden administration has deprived us of this possibility. At the moment when, out of sheer material greed and Germanic arrogance, she forced the Russians to turn to the Chinese. The Russians were potentially our most powerful ally against China. A Christian, European people, Caucasian character.
Not recognizing this fact is a catastrophic, historic mistake by the Biden administration. We will all have to pay dearly for this mistake. Our luck so far is that the Russians are a level-headed people, that Putin is a predictable, level-headed president. However, I wonder how long the patience of the Russians will last?",CNN
kyaALHVnEW8,"Ich schreibe hier in einer Sprache, die nicht meine und nicht die Ihre ist. Anders jedoch geht es an dieser Stelle nicht.
Es ist Zeit, das Schweigen zu brechen, es ist Zeit sich zu Wort zu melden, sich zu empören. Angesichts der gezielten Verdummung der Bürger durch Mainstream-Medien. Ich bin Europäer, ehemaliger Offizier eines NATO-Partner-Landes. Mir steht es nicht zu, mich in die inneren Angelegenheiten der USA einzumischen. Das habe ich auch nicht vor. Das steht allein den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern der USA zu. Die Amerikaner haben hervorragende Experten zum Thema Ukraine. Jedoch hören mehr als 40% der US-Bürger diesen Experten nicht zu, oder sind intellektuell nicht dazu in de Lage, den Ernst der Situation und die Folgen zu verstehen. Also muss ich mich zu Wort melden, um den Amerikanern – jenseits der Medien – einen anderen Blickwinkel, eine andere Sichtweise aufzuzeigen.
Ich hoffe, dass das amerikanische Volk begreifen wird, dass die Biden-Administration einen historischen Fehler begangen hat, als sie beschloss in der Ukraine einen offenen Krieg mit der Russischen Föderation anzufangen. In der Ukraine geht es schon lange nicht mehr um Freiheit und Demokratie. Es geht um die Etablierung eines autokratischen Regimes, welches die Freiheit selbst mit Füßen tritt und auf Korruption und Unterdrückung andersdenkender aufgebaut ist. Die Etablierung einer Oligarchie, die nur die Profitgier und die Durchsetzung nationalistischer Interessen, kleiner Kreise diesseits und jenseits des großen Teiches befriedigen soll.
Wir, die europäischen und die US-Amerikanischen Bürger, finanzieren in der Ukraine, die Umsetzung der Träume des deutschen Führers und Reichskanzlers Adolf Hitler. Den Traum der „Eroberung von Lebensraum im Osten“! Hitler und Goebbels prosten sich in der Hölle zu und lachen sich einen ab, angesichts unserer Blödheit. Denn, was in der Ukraine gerade passiert ist die Schaffung und Bereitstellung von Lebensraum für die „Germanische Rasse“ (so sehen die sich wieder selbst). Man höre der heutigen selbst ernannten Elite der Deutschen aufmerksam zu. Explizit meine ich hier die Partei der Grünen und ihr Flaggschiff Baerbock. Vor den versammelten Parlamentariern der EU erklärt die deutsche Außenministerin „We are fighting a war against Russia!“ Ohne dass dies irgendwelche Folgen für sie gehabt hätte. Nein, wir Europäer führen diesen Krieg, der Deutschen gegen die Russische Föderation, nicht! Wir wollen auch keinen Krieg gegen die Russen führen.
Seit mehr als 30 Jahren, seitdem der Kommunismus sich erledigt hat, sehe ich zwei Gefahren für unsere westliche (vom Christentum, der Antike und dem Humanismus geprägte) Zivilisation. Das ist der politische Islam (der uns nicht wirklich gefährlich werden kann). Das ist aber vor allem der Han-Chinesische Nationalismus. Ein Nationalismus (unabhängig vom Kommunismus und der Kommunistischen Partei Chinas) welcher alle ekelhaften Züge des deutschen Nationalsozialismus während des III. Reiches trägt. Einer der Gründe, warum sich die Deutschen und die Chinesen so hervorragend verstehen. Dieser Han-Chinesische Nationalismus war in meinen Augen (vor dem Ausbruch des Ukraine-Konflikts) der Faktor, welcher wirklich den Weltfrieden bedroht. Denn dieser Han-Chinesische Nationalismus, wird uns nur zwei Möglichkeiten lassen. Entweder wir unterwerfen uns – Unterwerfung kommt für mich nicht in Frage. Oder wir zeigen den Han-Chinesen, dass sie – im Falle einer militärischen Konfrontation – nicht gewinnen, nicht profitieren können.
Dieser Möglichkeit, den Han-Chinesen zu zeigen, dass sie nicht die Herren der Welt sind. Dieser Möglichkeit hat uns die Stupidität der Biden-Administration beraubt. In dem Augenblick, in welchem sie – aus reiner materieller Gier und germanischer Überheblichkeit – die Russen gezwungen hat, sich den Chinesen zuzuwenden. Die Russen waren potentiell unser mächtigster Verbündeter gegen China. Ein christliches, europäisches Volk, kaukasischer Prägung. Diese Tatsache nicht erkannt zu haben, ist ein katastrophaler, ein historischer Fehler der Biden-Administration. Diesen Fehler werden wir alle noch teuer zu zahlen haben.
Unser bisheriges Glück ist, dass die Russen ein besonnenes Volk sind, dass Putin ein berechenbarer, besonnener Präsident ist. Ich frage mich allerdings, wie lange die Geduld der Russen noch währen wird?",CNN

Western media admits US 'threatening defeat' in Ukraine
Western media have recently admitted that the Ukrainian army has stagnated. What's behind this abrupt change of heart about Kiev's counter-offensive?
After praising the Kiev regime's determination and the ingenuity of the Ukrainian armed forces for some time, the US mainstream press suddenly changed its tune and was forced to admit that the Ukrainian counter-offensive had failed. Some US media outlets even reported that US military tactics proved almost useless on the battlefield in Ukraine.
""After two months, the American press is finally realizing that the Ukrainian counter-offensive is going extremely badly,"" said independent journalist Daniel Lazare.
From the start of the counter-offensive until August 4, Ukraine lost more than 43,000 troops and more than 4,900 units of various weapons, including 26 aircraft, nine helicopters, 1,831 tanks. In addition to other armored fighting vehicles, including 25 German-made Leopard tanks, seven French-made AMX wheeled tanks and 21 American-made Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs), according to information from the Russian Ministry of Defense. In that sense, Ukraine's defection rate is so high that it could hardly be ignored by Western politicians and the corporate press.",CNN

kyaALHVnEW8,"It seems hard for people who don't understand warfare and military operations as a whole to understand why Ukraine is losing. First Ukraine is running out of men. Now that isn't to say Ukraine can't round up conscripts by the tens of thousands and throw them at Russians but they don't have the motivation to fight not to mention time to train properly or equipment. 

They are taking civilians, putting them in uniform, giving them a rifle and saying shoot Russians. Most of Ukrainian casualties are not from small arms, it's overwhelmingly from artillery, armor, drones, mines etc. So having tens of thousands of un-trained infantry will do nothing against Russias entire war machine. It's like bringing a knife to a tank fight. 

Worse yet is westerners think giving Ukraine tanks, Bradley's, armored fighting vehicles and jets will bring victory, that's so far from reality. Let me explain. 

One tank, one Abraham's tank just ONE to be effective needs a tank crew of four minimum, you will need around 2 to 3 mechanics for the one tank, an Armourer, Electrician, Instrument Tech, Communications Tech, Gun Fitters etc. 

This is to repair, maintain, just keep it going, just the one machine in a combat operation. Now imagine this, France giving tanks, America giving tanks, Germany giving tanks, armored vehicles of all kinds etc and all in different designs and languages. Each one of these machines is a military specialty in and of itself same with jets and all other machines.

So do the math, think of the logistics in battle. Ukraine has hundreds of different machines from dozens of countries and Ukrainians don't know shit about any of them. 
Sending Ukraine tons of equipment and thinking this will bring victory is insanity. You need to face reality, Ukraine is lost, its not if it's when.",CNN

Polish authorities plan to create a Polish-Ukrainian unit to later occupy western Ukraine, said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. He pointed out that Western countries are in a proxy war against Russia, and especially the US, which is exacerbating the conflict by supplying Kiev with increasingly lethal weapons.
Poland has become the main instrument of US anti-Russian policy and declares its intention to build ""the most powerful army"" in Europe, he told a meeting of Russian Defense Ministry leadership.

Have patience. I am trying to condense a 15 year saga into a comment length bulletin. Please think of each sentence as a chapter in a tome.

FYI
I might be sending you on a Treasure Hunt.
Please check everything I am asking you to check.
Talk to people with a high enough security clearance or folks might think you have lost your marbles.
The Russians are here on American soil, in bed with the Indian mafia and their thousands of hackers and scammers.
They want the US out of NATO.
They have a boatload of sex tapes, fake and real, of decision makers in the US and that's why the decision makers are making shabby decisions. Nobody cares about old people in grainy sex tapes in the post porn era.
The Russians are angry someone sold Alaska to the US.
The Indians are mad because they are being told that Native Americans moved to the Americas from India via boats and were Hindu. And that America and Australia were built by the British with the money they robbed from India.
They have played a role in union busting. 
They believe all top US owned BIG TECH and other industries will move to India for cheap labor.
Also, Google has been infiltrated, reportedly, from the janitorial service to the boardrooms. They need to go back to Russia.
They are threatening to kill the owners of Google and yours truly.
The FBI agent running the investigation was taking bribes.
The case needs to move forward with honest decent people who are skilled at their jobs.
Anyone with a reasonably high level of security clearance can get the information the military, the CIA, and the Air Force have on the satellite deployed FDA approved medical lasers these Russians and Indians are using as a tool for Coersive Control on American citizens on US soil.
The mafia aligned FBI agent needs to go.
They fired one, but he replicated himself through bribes.
There's a court date pending.
Lobby your law makers to very quickly outlaw laser activity by foreign entities on US soil and shoot down the mafia controlled satellites.
The medical lasers are invisible to the naked eye, can kill, maim, start fires, overheat metal, our guns are powerless against them.
Legitimate medical professionals are being used to act as hitmen.
Some of the people on the medical laser project call themselves behavioral scientists. Look for them in professional circles.  They are based in San Francisco.  Handing out bribes to cops and janitors in every building like candy. 
The bribe money comes from dead Russian billionaires and the scammers in India who are robbing elderly Americans. 
Check this out. 
Talk to people you know in the military and government.
Spend a few weeks researching this. Ask questions of medical professionals and laser industry and the military and CIA types.
Educate your family and friends too 
This is a Mano a Mano war-like operation.
The US population needs to also go Mano a Mano.
Check what's happening in your industry, bank, health records etc.
This is being watched by several other countries, China, Korea, Canada, Brazil to name a few, since 2014. This isn't a secret. The US population is only 340 million. Ever since corporations farmed out our bank and IT front end and back end our security has been severely compromised.
We need to forget about petty stuff and think about protecting ourselves.
Corporations need to get real about the national security threats and bring back all jobs to US soil. Only catch is they will have to pay $15-22 per hire instead of $2. They need to see the national security threat for what it is and stop being greedy. All those jobs coming back will jumpstart the US economy.
Please follow up on all leads.

kyaALHVnEW8,"1:00 Exactly right, attacking dug-in Russian forces behind multilayered defences with no air superiority, let alone air dominance, isn't something any country would want to do, so it's no wonder that the counteroffensive is moving slowly.

What Ukraine needs, in addition to LOADS MORE demining equipment, is the ability to hammer Russian logistics far behind the front lines.

Ukraine needs the following missiles to pummel Russian logistics and it needs hundreds of them:
- ATACMS
- The standard non-export variant of Storm Shadow (500+ km range vs 250km range)
- Taurus KEPD-350
- Land-launched NSM (which can hit land targets in addition to ships) 
- JASSM
- JASSM-ER
- Land-launched Tomahawks fired from the Typhon launcher (that can also fire SM-6 missiles that can shoot down certain types of ballistic missile)

ATACMS and NSM are ground launched missiles and the launchers can shoot and scoot, making the launchers hard to detect and take out.

JASSM, JASSM-ER and KEPD-350 could presumbly be launched from Ukrainian aircraft in the same way that Storm Shadows and SCALP-EGs are, fired from beyond the range of Russian S-300/S-400 SAM systems.

All these missiles would enable Ukraine to take out logistics bridges (including the Kerch bridge) and hit all the fuel & ammo dumps in Crimea and southern mainland Ukraine.

With logistics bridges taken out, especially rail bridges, Russia would find it extremely hard to resupply its troops, thus bringing the end of the war much closer.",CNN

The Russians queered the play when they seized the Volnovakha-Zaporozhe line and the left bank of the Dniepr to the west.  The Russian withdrawals from Kiev, Kharkov, and the right bank of the Dniepr gave a false hope that Ukraine's plan of seizing Crimea was still in play, while in reality the Russians were quite capable of defending territory where they were determined to make a stand.  And now that the Ukrainians have been beating their own brains out attacking in the Azov Sea direction to the tune of 500 - 700 (or even more) KIA per day, the initiative is passing back to the Russian side along other segments of the front.

I'll try to stick right to this Dreadful senseless war that could have been avoided from the beginning and I'll start out with How would we the United States feel if Russia and North Korea built a military base in Mexico on the border of Texas .     It's okay or is it for the United States to be sending their carrier Force Armada an international waters off the coast of China and go up and down the coast flexing its muscle. well that's what the Chinese and the Russians are doing in Alaska they figure well if the United States can do it we can too
  Russia has not in the least demonstrated to me that they absolutely do notwant to attack Western Europe LOL and March down the streets of Paris .

Become more important than the United States is problems we're having my god look what Joe Biden is done by flooding our country to probably before he's run out of office and disgrace close to 20 million illegal aliens. That cannot sustain itself. Ukraine is trying to fight a war in the 21st century with World War II tactics. Well let me bring you up to date This is war in the 21st century with lots of high-tech gadgets and gizmos of computerized weaponry and it will continue with more sophisticated drones and robotic weapons. This war was senseless and unwinnable before it even started. And like this guy from Illinois Congressman or whatever he is is doing the United States a great disservice with the lies he has been told to say. Listen to what he said about the military industrial complex and Patriot missiles . I'm just wondering how many of our politicians are preferred stockholders and all of these conventional obsolete weapons of war any tank on the battlefield is useless without air support and proper artillery support and of course infantry support. It's quite obvious with anyone with any intelligence that has a brain that can think where this is going. and instead of sending a whole bunch of money that we really don't have that's making our lives worse and the men that are getting slaughtered in Ukraine even worser it's time to start sending emissaries with a message of peace and bring this all to an end by pulling out. And only sending Aid Ave humanitarian nature call for a ceasefire. And try to get the best deal for Ukraine as they can with the promise of staying out of NATO which the Russians will absolutely not tolerate for their security reasons and not to take over the world LOL. and I don't care if you call me a racist or a Putin lover. I do not have the highest opinion of any of these corrupt leaders from these countries which you know damn well the Democrats with no oversight are embezzling millions of dollars from this us the taxpayers. Nothing I'm afraid is going to change until we run out of office Joe Biden and the activist s that are trying to destroy the middle class the Constitution and Bill of Rights. All of these Democrats are the same so if you replace one with the next you're going to get the same as the first one. And I'm afraid with many Republicans also. There is a good candidate from Florida who is not corrupt and a good man with morals and values that our country desperately needs a candidate who says what they're going to do and does it and he not just tells you what he's going to do but how and why the candidate with the best resume for the future of our great nation and people who he will serve and not the stockholders of Patriot missiles and all this other corruption that is just now so blatant as much as a lies they are telling us on a hourly and daily basis. the American people are fed up and tired and have had enough and want a new beginning and Future and neither Joe Biden corrupt Joe Biden or courtroom drama Donald Trump who talks and talks reminds me of Foghorn Leghorn he'll tell you anything you want to hear as long as you vote for him he has brought on so many things on himself. Buy one bad decision after the next and people with intelligence and others are waking up and seeing this to be true. Even if by some miracle he gets through all these Court proceedings and even more of a miracle wins the general election they will never stop attacking him like we saw on his term as president for 3/4 of the time he spent being impeached are wrongly accused of things I know it sucks but they're going to keep attacking and attacking him. I think Donald Trump for lighting a fire under the Republicans. But it's time for Donald Trump to step aside and let a younger better much more qualified candidate with values and morality that neither Joe Biden or Donald Trump have a clue of and will continue to rule and fear if either one of them are elected and I think the American people are done and want to move on I know I want to",CNN

In an indirect manner, yes. By drawing additional forces in to counter the tanks' presence, the areas from which russia's troops are being pulled will be weaker. In that sense, Ukraine can use the Abrams as their ""fluttering right hand"" and then reclaim more territory with their left. Right now, Ukraine has been mainly focused on cutting off supply routes and depots. They are buying time with precision strikes on railways and bridges while using mobile platforms to launch said attacks. Meanwhile, russia can only retaliate with civilian strikes and anti-air defenses. The problem with their anti-air defense network is that it requires ammunition and deliveries are getting more and more unreliable. 
 
That leads to a snowball effect where the less ammo that gets through to protect russian supply routes, the more supply routes can be disrupted. It's essentially the infamous ""Death by a thousand cuts"" where no one attack is crippling but you only need 1-2 to start the bleeding.",CNN

Excellent assessment from Ret. Mayor Mike Lyons, best so far. 👍🏻

If I may, in my opinion the UA offensive planing was a total failure, the west was totally wrong to think UA was given enough to get the mission done, since that hell of mines lands are impossible to penetrarte with the equipment UA have, the lands are a no go with the gear currently in use, unless the gear can levitate or fly. 
The only way I see to penetrate the defences is;
1. Massive air power, like helicopters and jets/bombers. Or at least REAPER DRONES in big quantities.
(or having all fpv drones in full tilt mode in big quantities hitting in mass all possible invaders accumulations in areas of attack, and drone pilots all active all the time, like wasp armies. And even then, mines are going to still be a pain in the ars... But with thousands of bulldozers and the non sufficient quantities of antimining gear, to be applied to open the corridors)
Or option 2.
Controlled forest/earth fires to eat everything the fire can open, paths to the tanks and personel carriers. (this sounds crazy, but I imagine fires will detonate the explosives in the minds, and nobody will stay in the fires while is burning, so fast strikes can break through in the fire territories).
Any thoughts about this ideas?

And 3rd.
Air defence is also lacking in quantity. 
All the civilian targets are in consequence of this. 
We all must understand than this war is a cancer, is not only causing death and pain to Ukraine, is also poisoning the global economy and progress. So if we all are honest with each other, the faster we end this war, we all won't be able to get back to pre pandemic grow and lives.

And there it is, the truth in their aspersions: ""If this war ended tomorrow the bridgehead in Kherson would be a DMZ."" They're mad because that crossing of the Dnipr ruins their plan to force Ukraine to the negotiation tables to then give up Crimea. Their talking point has always been that ""Ukraine has no chance to take back Crimea in this war so they should just let it go and end the war that way.""

kyaALHVnEW8,"About the only rationale for the Russian invasion is the Donetsk and Luhansk continued separatist militant internal strife independent of but backed by Moscow (had to get the weapons from somewhere) and Ukraine would not cede it to Moscow's allied power!
Sadly! The reason is it's ports and industrial complexes, that translates to and means ""money"".
Money, is not Ukraine patriotism, money is money!
Crimea itself is a far more rational problem than Luhansk and Donetsk in terms of Ukraine patriotism, However, long back in time the map of either Russia or Ukraine is old world when claim to the various regions has any root meaning (aka).
Sadly again, I find Ukraine held up immensely artificially of its existence and power, a worry too no different to a bank manager about loans ""as a metaphorical context""!
The real stepping problem is the truth of requirement for neutral existence as the final driving point of the Russian invasion.
AFAIAC As Far As I Am Concerned (how deep the thinking goes), US ships stopping allied shipments of weapons is pure simple stamped signed enacted directive and cause for Russia to non negotiate their security.
Until effected, Russia will not  consider it achieved their AKA border and ""buffer"" to NATO at any sensible level.
That's the US side of their security problems, the other is the fact Russia in terms of political existence creed is parallel to USA though a very different constitution , but in effect, it too does not allow either dictatorship or monarchy   creed, because of this, much of the world are a banned political structure because the world are either monarchy or dictatorship.",CNN

We're asking the Ukrainians to do something that we would never try to do and Russia is laughing all the way to the next mine field.

But if you word it ( like CNN did ) and ask , do you support Congress appropriating funds to continue to support Ukraine , you get a slight majority no , because of the American peoples distrust in congress ( go figure ) !    Is CNN purposely stirring an agenda or are they just stupid . Decide
I would add , the most beneficial weapon to save Ukrainian lives and deal Russia some major setbacks is the Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Great Britain .. The HIMARS were a tremendous success and proved that the Ukrainians knew exactly what they needed and proved to be very efficient with it and could be completely trusted ... Then the Russians adapted and moved  their logistics further back , mostly out of range of HIMARS , that's when the British made Storm Shadow missiles come in .. Over a year and 1⁄2 into this war and Ukrainian pilots aren't even formally practicing on F16's yet ?!  They are a 40 year old aircraft there is no secrets !  Portugal has 27 F16s and Portugal is about the size of the territory of Ukraine that is currently occupied by the invading Russians !! We would never send an American army to even attempt to do what the Ukrainians are forced to do and are doing !  The Russian Attack Helicopters weren't successful in entering Ukrainian territory and hunting HIMARS because so many Ukrainian soldiers were equipped with Stinger missiles and other air defenses they had to contend with that shot many 
down . But when  Ukraine has to bring their armour forward and contend with what is now the most mined country on earth as well as trenches anti tank ditches and dragon teeth , without air cover , it slows them down . Then Russian artillery and missiles zero in and Russia calls up some of their 250 attack helicopters that can come in flying 150 mph at 100 feet off the ground and fire tank killing missiles at a distance of over 12 km away . And they are equipped with night vision ! A few sorties flown by some F16s would eliminate a lot of that !!  Ukraine will never give up ! They will never go back to being a slave for Russia ! And they need their port cities in order to be a successful agricultural democratic country !  If you are not amazed impressed honored or like the Ukrainian people , then you are not following this war !
Every Ukrainian soldiers life is important to the Ukrainian government and they will continue to process this war in order to preserve as many of their soldiers lives as possible while continuing to degrade the command and control and logistical supply of the Russians ! When they've sufficiently degraded the Russian supply and they probed the weakest place in the Russian lines they will attack in force and continue attacking !

8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever. 

Malachi 3:6 
6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. 

Hosea 13:16
16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. 

Deuteronomy 13:6-11 
6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
7 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 
8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 
9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you. 

Ezekiel 9:4-7 
4 And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. 
5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 
6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. 
7 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. 

Psalm 9:17 
17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.

Isaiah 9:13-21 
13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of hosts. 
14 Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. 
15 The ancient and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. 
16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. 
17 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,  neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. 
18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. 
19 Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. 
20 And he shall snatch on his right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.",CNN

Ukraine need fighter jets and I believe this could very well be the turning point but it needs to be applied at the same times as the tanks.  Sending in tanks before getting the jets is not going to do it.  Putin is in this for the long haul.  This is where NATO (not including America) needs to step up production of weapons etc. because losing is not an option and will only open a conflict in other areas.  Russia are seriously struggling....make no mistake about it.  They have underperformed but this war just shows that all wars are different - Russia are fighting a very WW1 style war...which is the only way they can fight and can only be done if the country they are attacking is beside them which in this case it is.

This isn't about returning Ukrainian territories back. Think about this... If United States stops helping Ukraine to finish the counter-offensive, Russia will become stronger than ever in the eyes of other countries and many people, Russia will begin new attacks on other sovereign countries including cyber-attacks, they will learn their mistakes and become more sophisticated in military and economy, they are going to build a much stronger army for the next invasion, and in the next invasion there will be not only Ukraine, but some Europe countries as well. Moreover, they will spread their agents to change the governments of many countries to make sure the new government is pro-Russian. If you don't know how KGB/FSB works, you better educate yourself.

kyaALHVnEW8,"I hope the Ukrainians are open to taking targets of opportunity. While a breakthrough all the way to the Azov would be ideal, other achievements might be sufficiently meaningful to meet Ukraine's political goals of convincing the West that Ukraine can win with additional Western support. For instance, a breakthrough and/or encirclement in the east, where Russian defenses aren't as robust, might net the Ukrainians a useful bag of Russian prisoners. I don't know what numbers would be required to achieve a specific psychological/political effect. But if Ukraine could create a pocket of 25,000 Russians and capture them in short order, the effects would reach far beyond the battlefield. Fifty thousand Russian prisoners would create an effect more than twice as large. It may not be possible for Ukraine to break through the prepared defenses in the south with the assets available. The commanders on the ground are the best judges of that. If not, though, a breakthrough someplace else that nets a useful bag of Russian prisoners may serve a good enough purpose. If the Ukrainians can get through the Russian defenses in force anywhere, they can threaten to roll up the Russian fixed defenses from the rear. This will force the Russians to move reserves and air power to the breakthrough. Knowing how the enemy will react is an important ingredient of victory, and I hope the Ukrainians are able to exploit this.",CNN

 WW1 was at least three years of stalemate on the fronts, with no side being able to make advances. Millions of soldiers were fed into that meatgrinder with no significant gains from either side. WW2 was different because of the blitzkrieg tactics adopted by both sides and the inclusion of air power. That is no longer possible in Ukraine, if it ever was.

We also need to demand that America closes all 1,000+ non U.S. soil military bases and ops in 135+ countries and to end any other international military bases (they lust for many more).  Most countries are partially or completely sold out to weapons industry kickback corruption blood money and cannot be trusted.  We need to shift from militarizing the world for ''peace'' (profits), to demilitarizing a united planet for actual peace.

The way the world unites against Russia’s imperialist murderous invasion of Ukraine will send a clear message to China as it relates to Taiwan for example also.

This unity will make nuclear weapons as a deterrent unnecessary also which will greatly help us to finally end nukes worldwide.  We could and should end world hunger with but a portion of the savings too as an example of what a great leap towards world peace this would represent.

kyaALHVnEW8,If the military aid is stopped then all the money that has been spent so far will have been wasted and if putin gains control of Ukraine then what's next for his dream of reuniting the old Soviet empire. Already Belarus is stationing forces near the Polish border and a win in Ukraine would incentivize putin to expand his reach. The U.S. has in my opinion done the proper thing  in Ukraine so far and have to  win sgainst putin so I believe the military should deem this Ukraine war a must win no different than if the Russians were on the U.S. border threatening to conquer U.S. territory because if the Ukrainian army can't stop putin iI think it is inevitible that U.S. forces will be on the ground fighting Russian forces meaning a potential W.W.3. and while I think putin is bluffing with his nuclear threats a cornered desperate rat can be extremely unpredictable.,CNN

kyaALHVnEW8,"Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (August 6 and 9, 1945) USA. The only two uses of nuclear weapons to destroy people in the history of mankind. Many Japanese consider this use justified, some do not even know who used these weapons against them. The US maintains and spreads around the world the opinion that this was necessary in order to stop Japan and force her to capitulate. Yes, during the war, the Japanese troops behaved no less horribly than Nazi Germany, both countries and both armies carried out torture, concentration camps, tested biological and chemical weapons on prisoners and over the captured population in the occupied territory, rape and simply mockery, as well as mass murders.
But still, few people know that after the bombing of nuclear weapons on August 6, Japan did not surrender, but continued to fight. On August 9, the USSR declared war on Japan and entered the battle. On August 9, the United States again launched a nuclear strike on Japan, but the fighting continued, and only when the USSR army surrounded the Kwantung Army and broke through the defenses of Japanese troops in China, Korea and the Kuril Islands, on August 14, Emperor Hirohito (Jap. 玉音放送, Gyokuon-ho: co :) gathered a meeting with the generals and seeing that the army was almost defeated, he announced surrender.
So why was it necessary to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki? It was a test. Yes, yes, everything is simple and pragmatic. The documents on planning to strike Japan indicated the main goal - Field tests (for further planning of use in the USSR), the Americans knew that Hiroshima was a peaceful city in which there was no military industry, but a large civilian population density and a flat surface where Hiroshima was located , gave an ideal result in such experiments, which showed the degree of destruction of buildings and the degree of damage to living objects. The use of a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki was to test the impact on industrial buildings, such as steel mills, it was supposed to show the effectiveness of destroying industrial cities, to destroy the infrastructures of countries (later the United States often used the results obtained to destroy infrastructure in other countries in which they unleashed wars)
So, for the sake of experiments, nuclear weapons were used on people and about 240 thousand people were sacrificed, civilians, old women and children.
広島と長崎への原爆投下（1945年8月6日と9日）米国。 人類の歴史の中で、人類を滅ぼすために核兵器が使用されたのはたった2回だけです。 多くの日本人はこの使用が正当であると考えており、誰が自分たちに対してこれらの兵器を使用したのかさえ知らない人もいます。 米国は、日本を阻止し降伏させるためにはこれが必要だったという意見を維持し、世界中に広めている。 そうです、戦時中、日本軍はナチスドイツに劣らずひどい行為を行い、両国と両軍は拷問、強制収容所を実施し、占領地で捕虜や捕虜に対して生物兵器や化学兵器の実験を行い、強姦と単なる嘲笑を行いました。 、大量殺人も同様です。
しかし、8月6日の核兵器投下後も日本が降伏せず戦闘を続け、8月9日ソ連が日本に宣戦布告し参戦したことはほとんど知られていない。 8月9日、アメリカは再び日本に核攻撃を開始したが、戦闘は続き、8月14日にソ連軍が関東軍を包囲し、中国、朝鮮、千島列島の日本軍の防御を突破した。 、裕仁天皇 (Jap. 玉音放送、玉音放送: co :) は将軍たちと会議を開き、軍がほぼ敗北したのを見て降伏を発表した。
では、なぜ広島と長崎に原爆投下する必要があったのでしょうか？ それはテストでした。 はい、はい、すべてがシンプルで実用的です。 日本攻撃計画に関する文書には、主な目標である実地試験（ソ連での使用をさらに計画するため）が示されており、アメリカ人は広島が軍需産業がなく、民間人口密度が高く、平和な都市であることを知っていた。広島が位置する平らな表面は、このような実験において理想的な結果をもたらし、建物の破壊の程度と生物への被害の程度を示しました。 長崎への核爆弾の使用は、製鉄所などの工業用建物への影響をテストするためであり、工業都市を破壊し、各国のインフラを破壊する効果を示すことになっていた（その後、米国は得られた結果をしばしば使用した）戦争を始めた他国のインフラを破壊するため）

As long as the Europeans were willing to spend enough money and/or tolerate a few temporary chinks in their own defense posture, they could find ways to get Ukraine what it needs. The current position of the Europeans seems to boil down to something like the following: ""Given that we are unwilling to make any temporary sacrifice in the quality of our easy lives, and given that we're unwilling to accept even a very small risk of soon ending up in war somewhat short on arms, we cannot make up the difference if the US reduces its aid to Ukraine."" But if Europe abandoned those givens, then Europe could make up the difference. To persevere through WWI, Germany endured several years of extreme hunger resulting in more than 400,000 civilian deaths from starvation. If the Germans could endure that starvation, they can endure, for example, a temporary cut in their paid vacation time from the standard four weeks to two weeks -- and then devote the funds that would've paid for two weeks vacation and use it to aid Ukraine. After all, in the US two weeks paid vacation is considered good -- and many Americans get only unpaid vacation.",CNN

After, they can return to their subjective reality. Brief history lesson on CNN: the network got its start covering the gulf war behind enemy lines, brought insightful and and honest coverage. Sadly, this no longer exists. Instead of discouraging war they’ve become war monger’s. The world now looks at the left synonymous with pushing a proxy war. Also, if you think only 55% of Americans disapprove of another package, you are mistaken. It is much higher. This is the most dishonest coverage I think I have seen anywhere in the world. Please if you are solely getting your Russian/Ukrainian news here I implore you to look elsewhere. And I don’t mean Fox News. Do your viewers truly believe you? Your overt propaganda? The world coverage is much different. Reporting out of Eastern Europe for months has been stark! CNN also won’t tell you Ukrainian officials have been executing dissenters while Putin  routinely calls for summits to discuss peaceful resolutions. A meeting that zelenskyy and the US deny. Why? The Ukrainian people are being genocide and the left supports this, what is going on? Every sitting president since Clinton has had the understanding that Ukraine nor Georgia will ever join NATO on Russias doorstep. Joe Biden as Obamas V.P. was tasked to handle Russia. He implored Obama to intervene with the 2014 skirmish. Thank God Obama not only refused but took Biden off of any oversight for such a demented dream that we live now.

So the reality is the cost in either direction now has to be analyzed as a fundamental change in the expectation of lifestyle for the people there. It will now be ""industry"" but what kind of industry? Find a path to a treaty to lose the land but still benefit form its resources and rebuild and use any new money to help wipe away the generational debt of the conflict. When we look at how nations like Germany or Britain are built back up after a conflict it has alot to do with the world's commitment to those entities as pillars. The work to make Ukraine sustainable for people again is not insignificant. Even in the US we have areas we are still trying to bring back in restoration from our own Civil War. If the US had been more damaged from direct conflicts as Ukraine and Russia are, it may not have been able to participate in World War 2 at all.

It absolutely goes against all military logic and doctrine to lauch such a counteroffensive with no air superiority even at local level. The Russians have constructed the most formidable defence fortifications and elaborate minefields in Europe since WW2. The Russians had time to build these due to the wests procrastination in delivering weapons. All the top Ukranian military wanted to launch a counteroffensive months ago before the Russians dug in and they naively thought they would have F-16 jets and numerous modern tanks. Despite the publicised talk about western tanks to Ukraine in simple military terms they have not had enough numerically. According to some sources only 10% of the Leopard 1 has been delivered. Did people naively think Ukraine was going to launch a counteroffensive and march into the sunset to victory and defeat the bad guys? Ukraine should have had everything it asked for from a bullet to a F-16 Jet. However let's be honest here and state truthfully that NATO does not want this war to end quickly despite the contrary public speeches. They want to see the Russian military and economy to haemorrhage in Ukraine hence the slow process of the delivery of weapons to Ukraine and some they wont supply.

Last year Russia was outnumbered 3:1, with inexperienced troops and no defensive fortifications. Now they're at a 1.3:1 advantage, with highly experienced, months trained, newly equipped troops with new capabilities and updated doctrine and massive defensive works throughout the entire theatre, while Ukraine is losing 5000 personnel per week and barely penetrated an insignificant portion of the Russians' first defensive order, in one place.

Ukraine settles into a defensive posture. 7) Russia launches an offensive with limited success, fronts move a few km but that's about it. 8) Peace along the river Dnipr, eastern Ukraine becomes Russian and Ukraine is barred from entering NATO, but will be allowed to join the EU (if Ukraine can get 27 member states to unanimously vote yes which at this point is unlikely).",CNN

My own government and the US government: men and women without balls and strict principles.

The time frame to properly supply Ukraine is gone, meanwhile Russia was able to strengthen minefields, dig trenches, an setup dragons teeth an other obstacles. All while the West was moving along like a snail, Ukraine was never even given a minesweeper, and minesweeper flail, they were given assault bridges, tanks aren't there until Fall. The F-16's are just a stall, and Western media for the last year has crushed and stamped out any intelligence advantage Ukraine had on Russia, gave Russia possible battle plans, an, or defense plans, an, or options, and got hundreds of civilians killed by airing safe zones all on the media. Now the United States of America is literally having to salvage a geopolitical relationship, because Ukraine can give up any day, not saying they will, but if there's a stalemate, how long until Russia invades Ukraine again, like they did with Crimea and now. This failure or struggles Ukraine is facing is from utter incompetence in Western leadership costing the lives of not only Ukrainian's but our own citizens and veterans who are in Ukraine as we speak fighting with Ukraine. None of this gets into future plans of Russia and places like Moldova, with heavy Russian demographics an USSR allegiances, an other countries with Russian and Chinese influence, or the fact if Russia gets Ukraine, what's to stop Russia fron Alaska after Western aid, or Mexico reclaiming parts of Texas with Russia, and Chinese help, or instability in the Middle East, and since USA failure in Ukraine signals success for China in Taiwan. I mean seriously how many times does the United States of America need to mess up before you people realize you're going to get us all killed, it's not like these mistakes happen over centuries, no, it's been back to back failure. Like the reigning champion of losing is the United States of America. This was avoidable, but my hands are on it, an I want Ukraine to have their territory back and still not be apart of the EU, or.

Ukraine would benefit by concentrating on the destruction of Russian infrastructure in the area like the complete destruction of the Crimean bridge over and over and over again.

All wars become financial. Russia can't sustain a 20 year war on their financial situation. That's what Ukraine should plan for. Like Vietnam did. Like Afghanistan did. The never ending destruction of Russian infrastructure in the area. In time, they'll collapse and leave.",CNN

China, Russia, India, North Korea and more hate the West and I think this is just the start of ww3. Not saying full on but will in some way impact is all.
The West has become weak with easier living and that's fine, but the issue is countries who dictate and manage their population in poverty will always have one over on you unless you put manoeuvre them.

mPbkdmYkGjQ,"Former naval officer. No particular Valor but it offers some perspective. This is a stream-of-consciousness because there were so many lies of omission here that it's impossible to keep up.

Yes, the Russians have done terrible things, but the Ukrainian leader has taken everybody out of his house to put him at the front like cannon fodder. We're talkin about cripples, old men. We're not discussing the millions of people who have fled as refugees towards Poland, Hungary. Ukraine was, is, will always be a failed corrupt oligarchy.

""This is not a territorial dispute?""  This is PRECISELY a territorial dispute. To Eastern provinces voted in referenda asking to be liberated, possibly join the Russia. US backed coup d'etat on 2014, the elections that were overturned by the West in order to facilitate that. Not once has Chris Christie question Joe Biden's involvement in barismo, his son (Hunter's) payment and the quid pro quo that gor the prosecutor investigating Biden son fired.

Not once in this entire conversation did he mention the United Nations, or Peace Accords turned down by Zelensky. Not once were they brought up. 

Not once has the Governor mentioned newspapers shuttered, websites put down, churches closed, political rivals imprisoned, elections stalled.

Not once has CC mentioned soldiers sitting hungry in foxholes & buildings not being fed, the fallen not being taken away. Where has all the 140 billion dollars?

Not once did he mention the Eastern provinces that should been let go because that's what they voted for in a referendum. I thought this was about democracy and self-determination.

That makes CNN Anderson Cooper complicit in a prolonged unnecessary proxy war. It makes Chris Christie like any neocon wanting to support the military-industrial complex.

Sorry about the children but we have no business in Eastern Europe.. Colonel Douglas Macgregor, Scott Ritter have clearly defined the war as lost for Ukraine. 

Zelensky is a puppet, former actor, playing prime minister. There is no accounting for the money that we have squandered in Eastern Europe. The man is ""playing"" Winston Churchill. The fact that Chris Christie wants Ukraine to win means he ignores our complicity and having moved NATO East. That puts him in the Warhawk neocon camp. Not voting for the former Governor.",CNN

P.S. the attacks on the church are officially sanctioned by Zelensky and  not the behaviour of Russian forces. Zelensky runs Ukraine as a Nazi infested dictatorship. No independent media, no political opponents (jailed), jailing Christian Priests and damaging churches. Banning Russian language and the murder of 14000+ Russianspeaking Ukrainians in the Donbas since 2014.  The facts are there.

mPbkdmYkGjQ,"I am going to stop watching news for a while because it makes my head hurt. If this is what Christie genuinely believes, then it is better he does not become president despite being a very good governor of NJ. Russia can always escalate (though it hasn't done so). If Russia is truly defeated to the level that he is saying, there would probably be a revolution and unlikely they would take it without responding. If Ukraine has gotten everything short of nukes since day 1, at minimum Russia could cut off pipelines from Norway just like Nord Stream was bombed. It could also cut Atlantic cables. 

Would the West go into a shooting war with Russia over this? How many people dying would be enough? If the shooting does start, how do you stop it or do we get into the situation Ukraine finds itself right now that there are no ways out of a shooting war except a total victory or potential devastating defeat? 

The China conflict won't end until either China finds a way to displace the dollar in a significant way in some parts of the world or there is a Chinese collapse. There can be no anti-American coalition that succeeds without China yet it seems conflict even if no shooting wars is inevitable. Regarding Taiwan, I don't believe it would be taken over in a D-day invasion, but if it is taken over since all these politicians believe it will. The lithography imports would stop and the role that Taiwan occupies in the semiconductor industry would go to somewhere else. Taiwan can't make chips without Western imports.

We CANNOT allow him to become president again! Just imagine how vindictive he would be. Imagine how spiteful he would be, and the revenge he would try to get on anyone who opposed him. He is mentally unstable, and totally unfit to be president. It’s really quite alarming that millions of Americans still support him.. to the point of being almost cult-like. We clearly have SERIOUS issues we must address. In my opinion, it indicates that we have a serious problem in our educational system, because no one with an ounce of sense and intelligence would fall for Trump’s grift. No one who can think for themselves would support him. We also obviously have a serious problem with mental health, because no one of sound mind would stand with Trump.

JB57sf112So,"I would like to see more balanced reporting rather than western mainstream media propaganda. We must look to independent journalists such as Patrick Lancaster, and independent analysts like Colonel Macgregor and Jeff Sachs - amongst many others - to fully understand the reality. Where are the reports of Ukrainian soldiers massacring Ukrainian citizens in their hundreds with NATO-supplied weapons? Eye-witness reports exist but are not given coverage. Ukraine is losing and losing badly, but the body bags are not European or American so nobody cares. The zombie clown Zelensky is a disgrace.

Worth repeating, without economy, the military is virtually worthless and once China helps the evil terrorist-horror-devil Russian army, stealing Ukraine children, killing and wiping out Ukraine cities, etc. we are worrying about how China would react (my my?),  if we provide very highly warranted Apache and Blackhawk helicopters to homeland defender Ukraine?

Is this how Superpower is acting? Shame on you all aforementioned morons and imbeciles minded cowards indeed mostly US and few UK, not providing Wild cat and Leonardo's helicopter and even so small JUST 2-squadrons of Euro-fighters and UK is 100-fully protected by US, so what is worry about providing aforementioned UK helicopters and lousy 2-squadrons of Euro-fighters UK, even after messing up Urkaine’s Budapest Memorandum blunders, I have already pointed out number one blunder is my country; yet, I will refrain from calling WH leaders and Pentagon leaders are air heads, common senseless total morons and semi-cowards, and the rest!

""But also, there would be a SURPRISE OUTBREAK""

*****************

outbreak (noun) · outbreaks (plural noun)
a SUDDEN occurrence of something unwelcome, such as war or disease:

sudden (adjective)
occurring or done quickly and UNEXPECTEDLY or without warning:

surprise
an UNEXPECTED or astonishing event, fact, etc.:

► Therefore, a SURPRISE OUTBREAK = an UNEXPECTED, UNEXPECTED DISEASE or war ◄

*****************

In late 2019, there appeared an UNEXPECTED DISEASE (outbreak) in this planet of ours, namely Covid-19 (I don't know of any other, do you ?).

 In 2017, Anthony Fauci addressed a congregation of adults at a university (while they were in line waiting to get their food) and convincingly foretold to them that during the next 4 years there was going to be an OUTBREAK namely Covid-19 (I still don't know of any other, do you ?) which would be a SURPRISE to the Whole World because nobody, except him and those who were paying attention to what he was saying while they were in line waiting to get their food, would be EXPECTING !!!

How is it that that “Prophet” knew that there was going to be a “Surprise Outbreak”, namely Covid-19 (I still don't know of any other, do you?), when it was going to happen, yet he didn’t know from where it was going to Originate ???

Were those GULLIBLE FOOLS, who were in line waiting to get their food, that hungry that it didn't cross their ""academic"" minds to ask Anthony Fauci that VERY CRUCIAL QUESTION ???

Why, on earth, when there finally was someone who wanted to ask that VERY CRUCIAL QUESTION, there was the greatest of efforts to prevent her from doing precisely that ???

But a complete coverup of the debacle is more difficult than in Afghanistan and Iraq.  There, they could pretend  they were not defeated.  Here a loss will be seen by the rest of the world as powerful Russia putting the US and the west in its place in a way no one else could.  That causes burning.    The Germans smarted when the master race was defeated by the Red Army.  Like that, the master societies of the west will be smarting when defeated by Russia. It is the end of the 'international rules based order', that is, the western order.  Russia's achievement goes far beyond military and territorial conquest. It has changed the world order and even the international financial system and trade flows, hitherto dominated by the west.  It is a momentous achievement.

In Vilnius, the US surrendered to Russia when it vetoed Ukraine's entry into NATO, and refused to give a time map.  The US would not have done that if it believed Ukraine can win.  The US  conceded a key Russian demand.   Two US Presidential candidates, Trump and Ramasamy, have declared they will get rid of Ukraine and have a settlement with Russia.  The rest of the Europeans show bravado but are weak in the face of Russia and cannot change the outcome of the war, which is defeat for Ukraine.  When the US gives up, the Europeans will change the narrative and follow suit.

As the BBC reporter now admits, Russia is resurgent and will go after Kharkov oblast.  In the south, Ukraine cannot break through, although western media is trying to project hopeful news.  Ukraine can launch some drone attacks on Russia but they are pin pricks.

The US has been duplicitous promising Ukraine support for however long it takes, and Ukraine has been foolish to believe that Ukraine would gain European status and western benefits by antagonising Russia.  Due to Ukraine's folly, it has lost the country that was given in 1991 and it has become a failed state.   It was foolish to think Ukraine could afford to antagonise a superpower neighbour, using the support of another superpower from across the Atlantic.   Ukraine was given independence without any bloodshed by Russia in an orderly manner, in all good faith, and trust.  Therefore Ukraine should have maintained good relations with Russia and not sought to have US missile and naval bases in Ukraine.  That was backstabbing Russia and Ukraine now has to pay the price.    It will soon find the US is a fair weather friend.",BBC

All  African countries north of the equator should be made members of NATO war group after the fall of communism. The United Stated States is a republic. That simply means that, All African countries north of the equator may become members of NATO group if the United States wants it, after the fall of communism. Vested interest groups and business owners have more power in the US. Meanwhile,  The word : Nazi: and the Moscow statement, ""Nazis and followers of Hitler  are controlling lynch mobs in Ukraine"" are in general based on  a misnomer. Ukraine was created by Romanov dynasty Queen Katherine the great in 1783 out of Ottoman territory in order to create a homeland of Cossacks who claim to be originally from Kyiv. Local Cossack chieftains already re-captured or liberated their supposed historical capital Kyiv from Ottoman warriors way back in 1667AD.    The word Nazis is a misnomer. Russia calls ""They must be followers of Hitler"" all unemployed men from west Ukraine who organized protest marches in ethnic Russian neighborhoods. They march through ethnic Russian neighborhoods and in Russian speaking towns such as Odesa with burning wooden torches in their hands. These men ride by motorcycles, new and old, starting across Ukraine from either Kyiv or Lviv City to organize protest marches and to create chaos in  Russian speaking towns such as Odesa.  Not a single arsonist either in Ukraine or the USA and not a single arsonist living in the western hemisphere, as mentioned in many Forensic Files episodes of the US, were ever followers of Hitler. Internet research at the time indicates: These incidents of arsonists marching through Russian speaking towns like Odesa, KKK style,  happened before the war of 2022. An arsonist or ethnic Ukrainian protest marcher marching with a lynch mob in Russian speaking towns of Ukraine such as Odesa are often branded as being a few Nazi supporters by spokespersons in Moscow. In Ukraine, ethnic Russians and Cossacks were likely always stupid, as they used to sign up for military service for the last 50 years. This created an opportunity for ethnic Ukrainian military officers, most likely to sacrifice ethnic Russians by fighting wars after war by sending them to Donbass and the salt town near by. Ethnic Ukrainians of central Ukraine and west Ukraine were more interested in increasing their populations. and to stay Intact and alive during earlier wars, most likely. From what I had read, military officers hired by Kyiv are predominantly ethnic Ukrainians. Possibly four years ago, there are Youtube videos. That time, large motor cycle borne groups of men, many ethnic Ukrainians along with some ethnic Russians in their ranks would travel on old motor cycles and new motor cycles to ethnic Russian speaking cities such as Odesa. In Odesa, the lynch mobs travelling east from Lviv city and Kyiv killed 40 ethnic Russians in a public building on a street in Odesa which allows public access. as seen in Youtube video. Members of the Deep state of the western hemisphere may have possibly promised , although I doubt that, these groups of men coming from near Lviv and from near Kyiv, large sums of money or financial aid up to a trillion dollars, in exchange for burning down houses of ethnic Russians in Donbass or Odesa city or elsewhere. These non Nazi gangs are usually from Lviv area or Kyiv area. These marching groups with KKK style burning wooden logs would march through town after town. In one attack on a building in Odesa as seen on Youtube they lynch mobs descending on Odesa, which is a Russian speaking town, and  killed 40 people in Odesa. These attacks happened inside a building in order to kill 40 ethnic Russians in that building in Russian speaking Odessa. Anything which will bring in a trillion dollars in aid to this non NATO member is acceptable. This is reported on national TV in Russian Federation. Someone in Russian Federation says, ""Gosh, About 200 followers of Hitler have just reached Odesa by motor cycles from Lviv city. Now these followers of Hitler want to various ethnic Russian neighborhoods of Odesa and other Russian speaking cities and scorch their houses. Theses followers of Hitler are marching through these neighborhoods with burning logs of wood."" Fact: These threatening marches happened in towns such as Kyiv and Odesa. Fiction: These are not followers of Adolf of Hitler.",BBC

(Interestingly, they tended to pivot the question into 'what would I say to Ukrainian leadership?') In any case, without exception, their responses were peace-oriented, along the lines of ""We are all Slavs and should not be killing each other"". (Quite insightful when contrasted with the implacable hate-rhetoric coming out of Kiev and the fact that Ukrainian sports-persons cannot find it in their hearts to even touch the hand of a Russian opponent.) 
What struck me is the fact that I have never seen a frontline Russian soldier interviewed of the BBC or mainstream western media. Even though we supply weapons as a NATO member, the UK is NOT at war with Russia. Russians are people too: we should be allowed to hear what they have to say about the conflict and so make up our own minds about whether to disregard it. This is like coming across two random guys fighting in the street and listening sympathetically to whatever one says and coaching him, and putting the fore-fingers in the ears and going ""La, la, la, la, la"" when the second one speaks.
Why also does the BBC use February 24, 2022 as the beginning of time in relation to the conflict? Do British people not have the right to know that the roots of the conflict are in the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest where America decided that it would be advantageous to invite Ukraine to join NATO? Given that if this conflict continues to escalate - or Ukraine actually manages to hurt Russia - the likelihood is that Europe dies in a thermo-nuclear holocaust, don't the British public deserve to factor the incontrovertible evidence of Americas sponsorship of the 2014 coup and continuous spending on the Ukrainian army since then into their assessment of the conflict? Victoria Nuland of the state department and Geoffrey Pyatt, the ambassador to Ukraine co-ordinated the 2014 'Maidan' with the oversight of (then) Vice-president Joe Biden to install a puppet regime. Between then and 2022 America spent 4 BILLION churning out a new battalion for the Ukrainian army every 55 days from a base in western Ukraine. Why does the BBC insist on being the government's PR department by misdirecting the public in the arrant nonsense that Vladimir Putin is on a war of conquest when the fact and existence of the Minsk accords - signed by Ukraine - document that all he has been seeking since 2008 is that Ukraine has the same status as Austria or Switzerland - neutral - so that America can't use it to locate nuclear missiles on Russia's border. That Minsk treaty was negotiated by Angela Merkel - the leading 21st century politician in Europe. How is it not relevant to public debate among thinking people in the UK that this woman - who commands universal respect as generally the only grown-up in the room was so appalled by the 2008 invite to Ukraine to join NATO that she (seconded by France) defied America by vetoing it. Her reason: such a development would for Russian security amount to a declaration of War. If Europe's de-facto leader was able to recognise that as a legitimate concern straight out the gate, all the way back in 2008, how can the BBC, in good journalistic conscience vilify Russia over its having responded in a wholly and previously predicted fashion to American machinations in Ukraine? The treatment of Ukraine as a de-facto NATO member has forced Russia to take military action to force further negotiations on what it could never see as anything other than an existential threat to its continued existence. This is in principle no different from America being recognised as having been within its rights as a state to view the location of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba back in 1962 as tantamount to an act of war by the Soviet Union.
The BBC has shamed itself by being, at best, mealy-mouthed and selective in what it reports on this conflict, and at worse, just as active in the disinformation war against Russia as the military-industrial-CONGRESSIONAL complex (that was Eisenhower's original phrase) that is happy to buys Russian deaths with Ukrainian lives and has a profit-interest in perpetuating the conflict for as long as possible.",BBC

Among the successfully destroyed targets were factories in Zaporozhie, Vinnitsa and Kharkov; a blood transfusion centre; and an airbase near Khmelnitsky. On the plus side, yesterday, Ukrainians damaged an engine room in a civilian tanker and burned a University in Donetsk. I have a question to ask. Ukraine on a daily basis is shelling Donetsk and Gorlovka and being doing it for the past 9 years. Donetsk never had military within its perimeter, Gorlovka as a front-line town had military stationed on the very outskirts in some districts. Ukrainians are using Grad, Tochka-U, Himars, scatter anti-personnel mines in the very centre of these cities and now are using cluster munitions there -- and not a single report on these atrocities!

UKRAINE:  But we want peace, we want peace.
THE TRUTH:  But even though they have been offered numerous times to discuss the situation with Russia, directly from Russia, it goes on deaf ears.  The Ukrainians want the war.

ZELENSKY:  I am so hard done by, my people are so hard done by, we Ukrainians are so hard done by, whaaaa.  Give us more, just keep giving us more, or we will throw our rattle out of the pram and accuse the West of not helping, because I AM UNGRATEFUL and ARROGANT.  Who am I? and what am I?.  
THE TRUTH:  Zelensky and his country, the Ukraine are leeching off the West, are troublesome and have every intention to use Western heavy weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

I see this conflict for what it really is.  The Ukraine and the West want the war, they will continue on with the war until wham.  Britain will cop it and there will be no reprisals from NATO.  Britain is the Russians target and yes I can see London being wiped off the face of the planet and no reprisals from the West / NATO will take place in the form of a nuclear war.  The British seem to think striking back when this event happens is the most logical thing to do.  NOT HAPPENING BRITAIN, we all know you want it, but ITS NOT, I repeat, NOT happening.

The Ukes only stopped charging forward into minefields as the mines were going off, no info from MI6, CIA or anywhere else for that matter advised them as they can't have known or they'd have been advised. 
The fact is, to wage war for an extended period of time a country must have the resources to do so which is why the US has historically been so strong in WW1 and WW2, JApan invaded other countries to obtain resources it needed prior to and during WW2 as the Germans did too. 
Russian as shown in WW2 has the resources to match the US in manufacturing weapons of war and far from the rhetoric of the west claiming Russian tech is somehow inferior, it is a match and in some case superior to the Western equivalents and Russia can and IS producing weapons faster than the silly US/UK puppet organization Nato can. Even under Stalin, Russia whilst in retreat in WW2 produced 10s of thousands of tanks which German production could not hope to match and the same situation exists now. 
All this talk of Russia running out of weapons, poorly trained and supplied claptrap is just that.
MSM are only now talking of Ukes not winning as the facts are staring those in Western governments in the face that the lies of the CIA/MI6 and co, just like with Iraq and WMD, have been proven to be just that, lies designed to convince the populations to support the BS wars the west wages against others all in the name of greed. 
The Russian SMO was forewarned by Putin for years once Nato started expanding eastwards in breech of the agreement at the time of the breakup of the USSR, the US responded in a similar way when Russian missiles were placed in Cuba which isn't even on the US border as Ukraine in to Russia, and the Cuba issue arose over US missiles being placed in Turkiye and Italy facing the USSR.... funny how we in the west only tell the story to suit our narrative and convince the populace through mis information, propaganda and lies, and all for what exactly..... so some corporations can make even more $$ from exploiting some other country for it's resources?

This will be a slow and deliberate process, that will not sweep Russia away like a Tsunami. Well, not right now anyway. Bi

Compare Ukraines offensive to the Normandy landings where the combined forces of the British empire, America and free Europeans carried out a sea to land offensive with a similar size army against a similar sized entrenched enemy.

The Allies forced a bridge-head in Normandy, that was smaller than Ukraines current bridge-heads into Russian occupied territory.

The Allies, took 2 months of probing, testing and shaping the battlefield before they moved forward and captured their 2nd objectives!

After that, German occupation forces in France collapsed and the Allies liberated the entire country in the following 3 months.

Ukraine are curretly in the early stages of probing, testing and shaping the theatre, before they add the critical mass to the weak points that will cause Russias collapse.

So if anyone tries to tell you Ukraines offensive has failed and Russia has won, just post a 😄 imogee response to humour the fool, because they are talking out of their backsides. 🤔 🤭",BBC
9KNUwmOWC5I,"Why would the west be disappointed with Ukraines offensive.

To all those who think Ukraines offensive is failing, have unrealistic expectations.

I'll give you a clue - this is not a Hollywood movie. 

In 8 weeks, Ukraine has liberated 293sq miles of Russian temporarily occupied lands, through battle zones with well prepared defences.

 In comparison to Russia, supported by the entire might of the 2nd biggest military in the world taking 10 months, yes 10 months, to capture the half that area in the first place.

Let's not forget that Russias mighty Black Sea fleet has to stay in the far east of the Black Sea, scared to come within 300km of Ukraines coast. Forced out of Russias regional navy stronghold Savastapol and the Azov Sea by Ukraines actions. All that by a country that doesn't even have a navy! 

Let's no forget that Ukraines airspace is a ""no fly zone"" for Russias airforce, who can't come within 15km of Ukraines borders or cities for fear of being shot down and are relying on unmanned drones to do their work with decreasing success. 

Let's not forget that Russia has evacuated hundreds of thousands of Russians, both civilians and senior officers, from Crimea scared of Ukraines capabilities and a Storm Shadow visit or two, to Crimea and the Kerch Bridge.

Now tell me again you pro-Russians and trolls, that Ukraines offensive hasn't been successful so far? 🤔",BBC

9KNUwmOWC5I,"Yesterday I saw a very brave freelance journalist deliver a video report from the Russian side of the front line. In that report some soldiers in the trenches - including men local to the Donbas area - gave their answers to questions. The most striking feature of those interviews was their responses to questions along the lines of ""What would your message be to Zelensky?"". (Interestingly, they tended to pivot the question into 'what would I say to Ukrainian leadership?') In any case, without exception, their responses were peace-oriented, along the lines of ""We are all Slavs and should not be killing each other"". (Quite insightful when contrasted with the implacable hate-rhetoric coming out of Kiev and the fact that Ukrainian sports-persons cannot find it in their hearts to even touch the hand of a Russian opponent.) 
What struck me is the fact that I have never seen a frontline Russian soldier interviewed of the BBC or mainstream western media. Even though we supply weapons as a NATO member, the UK is NOT at war with Russia. Russians are people too: we should be allowed to hear what they have to say about the conflict and so make up our own minds about whether to disregard it. This is like coming across two random guys fighting in the street and listening sympathetically to whatever one says and coaching him, and putting the fore-fingers in the ears and going ""La, la, la, la, la"" when the second one speaks.
Why also does the BBC use February 24, 2022 as the beginning of time in relation to the conflict? Do British people not have the right to know that the roots of the conflict are in the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest where America decided that it would be advantageous to invite Ukraine to join NATO? Given that if this conflict continues to escalate - or Ukraine actually manages to hurt Russia - the likelihood is that Europe dies in a thermo-nuclear holocaust, don't the British public deserve to factor the incontrovertible evidence of Americas sponsorship of the 2014 coup and continuous spending on the Ukrainian army since then into their assessment of the conflict? Victoria Nuland of the state department and Geoffrey Pyatt, the ambassador to Ukraine co-ordinated the 2014 'Maidan' with the oversight of (then) Vice-president Joe Biden to install a puppet regime. Between then and 2022 America spent 4 BILLION churning out a new battalion for the Ukrainian army every 55 days from a base in western Ukraine. Why does the BBC insist on being the government's PR department by misdirecting the public in the arrant nonsense that Vladimir Putin is on a war of conquest when the fact and existence of the Minsk accords - signed by Ukraine - document that all he has been seeking since 2008 is that Ukraine has the same status as Austria or Switzerland - neutral - so that America can't use it to locate nuclear missiles on Russia's border. That Minsk treaty was negotiated by Angela Merkel - the leading 21st century politician in Europe. How is it not relevant to public debate among thinking people in the UK that this woman - who commands universal respect as generally the only grown-up in the room was so appalled by the 2008 invite to Ukraine to join NATO that she (seconded by France) defied America by vetoing it. Her reason: such a development would for Russian security amount to a declaration of War. If Europe's de-facto leader was able to recognise that as a legitimate concern straight out the gate, all the way back in 2008, how can the BBC, in good journalistic conscience vilify Russia over its having responded in a wholly and previously predicted fashion to American machinations in Ukraine? The treatment of Ukraine as a de-facto NATO member has forced Russia to take military action to force further negotiations on what it could never see as anything other than an existential threat to its continued existence. This is in principle no different from America being recognised as having been within its rights as a state to view the location of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba back in 1962 as tantamount to an act of war by the Soviet Union.
The BBC has shamed itself by being, at best, mealy-mouthed and selective in what it reports on this conflict, and at worse, just as active in the disinformation war against Russia as the military-industrial-CONGRESSIONAL complex (that was Eisenhower's original phrase) that is happy to buys Russian deaths with Ukrainian lives and has a profit-interest in perpetuating the conflict for as long as possible.",BBC

9KNUwmOWC5I,"READ ME!!! IMPORTANT!!!

The end is near!! Will you wait until it is too late?
Have you ever thought of what would happen to you today if you were to die?
Are you sure you're going to heaven if you die?
How can you be sure?


The most That beautiful Name, that beautiful Name,
From sin has power to free us!
That beautiful Name, that wonderful Name,
That matchless Name is Jesus!

to enjoy and live in the presence of God forever 
  



1. We are ALL sinners by nature and choice. 

Romans 3:10 KJV 
""As it is written, There is none Righteous, no not one."" 

Romans 3:23 KJV 
""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;""


2. The penalty for sin is death. 

Romans 6:23 KJV ""For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""


 The ""death"" mentioned in this verse refers to Spiritual death which means HELL. 

Wow!! The wages or payment for sin is death? How can I get to heaven then? 

3. We receive eternal life as a free gift! 

According to Romans 6:23 it is through the gift of God which is Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

 
But why would he give us a gift of eternal life? It is because He loves each one of us
and wants us to live with Him in heaven.


4. God demonstrated His love for us

Take a look: 
Romans 5:8 KJV But God Commendeth his love toward us, in that,
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.


Ok, that helps to answer ‘why’ ? 

Now the question is what must I do to be saved?  

5. Admit that you are a sinner, you cannot save yourself from death and hell, believe Jesus Christ died on the Cross for you and rose up on the third day, accept Him in your heart as your Lord and Savior 


Romans 10:9&10 (9)That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.


(10) For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 


God’s Word teaches us
that if you simply and sincerely believe in your innermost being that Jesus  took your place and died on the cross
for the payment of your sins, and that God raised him from the dead on the third day (found in Matthew 28: 1 to 20)you will be saved by your confession of being a sinner and asking the Lord Jesus to forgive you of your sins.
Because we are not righteous (none of us are), the only way to heaven is to ask God
to forgive you of your sins through believing prayer.  


Romans 10:13 KJV For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.


If you call upon Him for salvation God promises to hear you and you will be saved!!

Go to God in prayer
and sincerely pray a prayer like the one below and mean it in your heart:

Dear God, I confess I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I ask for forgiveness of my sins. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died on V.

If you have prayed this prayer and truly meant it in your heart ,
God’s Word assures you that you now have eternal life. 


*Eternal life means going to Heaven when you die

Only a week or so ago, Blinken did a song and dance about how well the Ukraine Summer Offensive has done. ""1/2 the territory had been re-taken"" according to his ""insightful"" report.

Anyone who has the minutest cynical bone knows that isn't the case. But talking up to give own side an injection of morale boosting drug is good for the TV, but still results do really matter, and Ukraine is far from doing VERY well.

The first analysis from Frank Gardner is more truthful and is believable. Geography doesn't lie. What about the second commentator Mick Ryan? Well, he is one of the cheerleaders in the western camp. He is a regular on the ABC Australia handing out glorious assessments of the western camp. But credit to the BBC, it provided two commentators instead of the usual ex-generals, ex-intelligence officials.

9KNUwmOWC5I,"The problem for Ukraine isn't undergrowth, undergrowth, etc.

The problem is that the West clearly says it wants Russia not to win - but their actions they show they desperately wish Russia not only to conquer all of Ukraine but also conquer after the Ukraine Moldowa and then Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and then move into the Baltic conquer these countries too and then advance into Poland, Bulgaria, Romania..

So the actions of the west where they continue to finance Russia and support Russia - doesn't match the words where they claim they want Russia to fail.

Officially, according to Eurostat March 29 2023, the EU wires Russia every month 6 Billion net cash to sustain its war effort. In total over 2022 the EU wired net cash 120 billion EUR to Russia.

When you consider Russia spends only 60 Billion on it's military, it's fair to say European Union is more than 100% financing the war in Ukraine.

While Ukraine is getting 1 billion or so a month from its European partners, Russia is getting still 6 Billion net cashflow every month from its European allies. Especially Germany is the biggest financier of Russia and as Scholz pointed out:""Russia can be assured Germany will do everything in it's power to ensure Russia is going to conquer all of Europe""

While Putin for this year increased the Russian defense budget to 1,5 fold - EU continues to pay 100% of all the Russian military costs.

So while Russia is getting the funds for big long range attack weapons and finance Su-57 and T-14 tanks... Ukraine is getting outdated 1980 stuff, which would cost dozens of billions of EUR/USA to dismantle them.. and dispose of this outdated stuff.

Russia, expecting the counter-offensive, has put work into building line, after line, after line of defences. If Ukraine wants to make real progress, they have to take ground faster than defences can be constructed, which at the moment isn't really the case. The aerial and naval aspects of warfare are almost moot, because both nations have strong anti-air and anti-naval weaponry. 

Can the counter-offensive succeed? I'm starting to say no, there simply is no way, even with better tactics, that the rate of advance can outpace the rate of russian defensive construction.

Can Ukraine still win the war? Definitely. Even with a massive defensive advantage, Ukrainian counter offensives have made ground, and we're quickly seeing Russia's internal sphere collapse, nationalised industries like Gazprom starting its own mercenary army, dissent in the army and more and more civil unrest at home. If Ukraine is to win, I think it'll be through attrition of morale, which Ukraine certainly has more of than Russian conscripts.

9KNUwmOWC5I,"Good BBC analysis of Ukrainian and Russian weaknesses and strengths.   On the plus side for Ukraine is that MI6 and the CIA are providing high quality, significant, and timely intelligence to Ukraine to allow them to formulate and adjust their military strategy.  To avoid the high fatalities of a ground offensive in the mined areas, I believe Ukraine will seek to heavily rely on high-end homemade drones and NATO supplied high end air offensive/defensive equipment to destabilize Putin’s grip on power.    I sense NATO unwillingness to supply  certain assets fearing Russia’s response.   

NATO’s response to the 2014 Crimean invasion by Putin probably contributed to Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine last year.

Obviously, this conflict could get ugly VERY fast if any NATO country is hit by the Russian military or Putin resorts to tactical nuclear weapons.   I don’t see Putin or the West stepping back from this conflict anytime soon, and NATO probably hopes the daily drone hits will wear out Putin’s power and ability to continue supplying munitions for his war.",BBC

9KNUwmOWC5I,NATO has hemmed and hawed about support. First tanks and infantry fighting weapons and next year possibly F16s and Swedish jet fighters. France has given Ukraine jet fighters but Ukrainian pilots don't know how to fly them yet. Our support is piecemeal at best. The US says that they know what Ukraine needs but does not give it until England does. The US army would never be making 1:1 ratio attacks that Ukrainian army is forced to do without first pulverizing the enemy for weeks of air attacks and first attaining air superiority. We are expecting the Ukraine military to work wonders without attack helicopters and jet fighters. They are making good incremental progress with what they have.  The Russian army is also proving that our antimine equipment is not enough.  The US army is not prepared to go through these kinds of mine fields either.,BBC
9KNUwmOWC5I,It is boots on the ground that mark victory not missile strikes. If Ua had a huge arsenal of missiles to hit Russia it would not move the AFU forward. The AFU absolutely must do better because support will wane soon if there is little to show. I don't like it but that is the way it is.,BBC
9KNUwmOWC5I,I feel like this counter offensive is going to be like when the Ukrainian army liberated kerson it was slow and caught the Russian by surprise were not going to see Ukraine fully liberated but we’ll see either teh front split in two or Donetsk and bakhmut it’ll happen so quickly and quietly no one will expect it (that’s what I can imagine and hope for),BBC

Russia's army is learning, expanding and getting progressively stronger, while Ukraine is running out if everything and has clearly demonstrated that they're army is incompatible with Western training and doctrine; theyre unable to accept and implement NATO standard TTPs, or utilize Western equipment.",BBC

It is now only a matter of time whether Ukraine will be enabled to force Russia to heal, or if western resolve will wain enough for Russia to militarily rectify its gross errors. If the objective is to allow Ukraine to restore its borders and bring Russia to a peace table then it must be allowed to strike key centers on Russian territory, gain Air and Sea superiority, and have unconditional long-term sustainable support without any fear of crossing 'red' lines.",BBC

9KNUwmOWC5I,"Ukraine doesn't want to drag this out because it's afraid that the US may have a new president come 2024, who may not be as supportive towards them as President Joe Biden has been. Also, there is concern that the other western leaders may be distracted by other issues and weaken their support for Ukraine too.

On another note, this counteroffensive may be sped up if the West allowed Ukraine to use the long-range weapons to hit military targets within Russia without any restrictions. Specifically the eastern-most regions of Russia. If Russia's ability to support their troops is severely weakened, then those troops fighting on the frontlines will cave more quickly if put under sustained fire and their frontline will collapse sooner. And with no more support in the rear, their retreat will likely have to be all the way back to Russia, hence giving up all that territory in the Donbas, Crimea and Melitopol areas.",BBC

At the end of the offensive Ukraine will settle on a defensive posture and try to absorb Russias attacks. 5) Russia will attempt a new winter offensive and gain very little. 6) Peace will be negotiated, eastern Ukraine will be taken by Russia, Ukraine will be barred from access to NATO but gain entry to the EU.",BBC

z1riW7za2EQ,"guy doing the talking doesn't know armor. All the big tanks have pretty much the same range. The real advantage is that the turbine is far more reliable in bad weather (coming soon). Plus the engine will run on just about anything. The main gun is only as good as the targeting software and sighting system. Even an early Abrams is the best in the world, and will force the Russians in a night fighting situation. This is a trap that the Abrams is best suited for. The Abrams will see and kill before the enemy even knows they're there",SkyNews

z1riW7za2EQ,"I don't think the Abrams will be any more effective than the Chieftain or Leopard in Ukraine.  Abrams is an excellent tank, but the experience of the crew and the tactics they use is more important and I don't think the Ukrainians, as courageous as they are, will not have the experience and honed tactics needed for maximum effectiveness.

The Saudis bought a lot of Abrams, but the lost a lot of them in Yemen by the rebels.  The quality of the tank is important, but the crew and tactics are more important.

One thing that might help is if the Abrams sent to Ukraine has the Trophy system that can protect it from most RPG's and ATM's.  I'm not aware of Trophy being able to defend against top attack ATM's.",SkyNews

At least that was better than MRE meals given by Obama! Lol.
But the US has about 3,500 M1 tanks in storage just rusting away that will NEVER be used for anything except being sold or scrapped someday. Biden should have immediately agreed to send 500 or more M1s from this inventory and begun training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s immediately while preparing some planes to send over there. Instead, just a bunch of DITHERING while Ukraine burned and thousands of soldiers and civilians DIED, because of his DITHERING. I'm ashamed of this fool!

The main thing about M1s for Ukraine is that is potential numbers. There isn't an infinite supply of Leopards 1 or 2 available. But there are well over 3000 M1s that are fairly well maintained in US storage, or 10x the number of tanks that Zalensky has requested, so effectively the US can provide an endless supply of relatively modern tanks that we aren't currently using. Add in 2000 Bradleys, and that the US is preparing to replace all of our Bradleys with a new vehicle and there are deep stockpiles to keep Ukraine in the fight indefinitely. And since we are replacing the vehicles with give to Ukraine with new vehicles for the units, the lobby for the military industrial complex is pushing hard on one side while those who support Ukraine on principle are pushing from the other side which is why less than 10% of each house of our Congress has voted against funding for Ukraine.",SkyNews

Even two months into this war, Putin again attempted a peace offer and it was about to be signed and then the British PM, Boris Johnson intervened and prevented the deal being signed because he said they would supply arms.

Like, tomorrow, Zelenskyy just says ‘heck, too many of my compatriots have died on the cross of westernisation already, we give in’.  Where would that leave us?  We’d have Poland as our front line - another unfair burden, another innocent country thrown forward as a rampart against Russian lunacy.  We’d just be supporting Poland and Romania instead, and we’d be giving Turkey anything it asked, too.  Ukraine really is our best partner to deal with this, partly as they commonly understand/speak Russian too.  Ukraine is a great ally to have, we’re lucky to have them as a our bulwark.

z1riW7za2EQ,"The delay in authorizing the M1 tanks and the F-16 fighters was both an agonizing and brilliant move by Biden.  They removed the prospect that Russia could claim this is a US-Russian proxy war as if the US was being dragged kicking and screaming to the table.  They helped reduce the ability of Russia to claim justification of using nuclear weapons.  People might roll their eyes that Russia needs to have some justification but keep in mind that while global condemnation doesn't matter in terms of any European or American response, there are still people they are allied with, namely China and many African authoritarian dictatorships they depend upon for many things.  Russia can't afford to have the entire world against them, which would be the case should they start using nukes without adequate justification.

I have a real fear that at some point Russia will reach for the Nuclear option.  The first move would be to engineer an ""accident"" at the Zaborizha plant.  By getting international energy observers into the plant this prosect has been noticeably lessened but not turned to zero.  Time and time again approaches Russia could use to avoid complete worldwide condemnation have been set aside.

ahNkBiB1Q7g,"The war in Ukraine continues for a number of reasons.

Russia's stated goals have not been achieved. When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, it claimed that it was doing so to ""demilitarize and denazify"" Ukraine, and to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. However, Russia has not been able to achieve these goals. The Ukrainian military has fought back fiercely, and Russia has suffered heavy casualties. The war has also damaged the Russian economy, and it has led to international isolation.
There is no trust between the two sides. The relationship between Russia and Ukraine has been strained for many years, and there is a deep mistrust between the two countries. This makes it difficult for them to negotiate a peace settlement.
The West is providing military support to Ukraine. The United States and its allies have provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including weapons, ammunition, and training. This has helped Ukraine to resist the Russian invasion, and it has made it more difficult for Russia to achieve its goals.
There is a risk of escalation. If the war in Ukraine continues, there is a risk that it could escalate into a wider conflict between Russia and NATO. This would be a disaster for all involved, and it could have a devastating impact on the global economy.
It is difficult to say when the war in Ukraine will end. It could continue for months or even years, depending on the outcome of the fighting and the willingness of the two sides to negotiate a peace settlement. The war is having a devastating impact on Ukraine, and it is also having a negative impact on the global economy. It is important to find a way to end the war as soon as possible, and to prevent it from escalating further.",SkyNews

 ""Vi befinner oss vid en vändpunkt. Jag skulle säga att det här förmodligen är det farligaste ögonblicket i denna kris och konflikt som vi står inför, eftersom Ukraina är på väg att kollapsa"", sa den amerikanske experten.

 McGregor tillade att den misslyckade motoffensiven från Ukrainas väpnade styrkor uttömde dem fullständigt, medan rysk militär personal eliminerade nästan alla enheter av ukrainska nynazister som hade NATO-vapen och utrustning och tränades av NATO-instruktörer.",SkyNews

ahNkBiB1Q7g,"Sean Bell admits that he does not know the state of Russian logistics but as the whole idea of the 'land bridge' was to secure logistics for changing situations,  Russia is hardy going to say what ordnance it has stored for 18 months along the Azov and Black Sea coastal strips.
He also forgets that Russia is well equipped for amphibious and littoral transport/warfare, with restored very large hovercraft, many transport 'cutters' of shallow draft and corvettes new to the navy as well as an enviable number of transport planes needing airstrips plus the rapid development of Beriev float planes -- incidentally tested off Crimea last year. The west lacks such assets, perhaps because its doctrine is land, sea and air as separate things instead of a top to toe mixture being available.
Aircraft carriers are the favoured projection tool of the USA and they can hold many types of planes including medium transport helicopters but they are extremely vulnerable by sheer size and their need for deep water. Huge escorts might look impressive but cannot 100% protect carriers the size of large villages from being disabled. They do not need to be sunk.
Bell should also consider Russia's submarine numbers and concentrate on newer composite shallow draft ones and semi-submersible large boats which can fire missiles and carry large loads. The west has not developed these but work in the UK has been in progress for some time, apparently involving Italy, Sweden and France by way of the large companies having R&D partnerships. The USA mentality is still 20th century but sometimes just lots of everything misses out small seas, shallows and medium to large rivers.

Any army would struggle to make progress against multiple layers of defence including large minefields, and especially without air superiority, let alone air dominance.

Give Ukraine the weapons it needs to hammer Russian logistics, and hundreds of them:
- ATACMS
- Taurus KEPD-350
- JASSM
- Land-launched NSM
- The non-export variant of Storm Shadow (500+ km vs 250km)

That will mean Russia will have no more fuel and ammo to continue waging this war, plus take out key bridges used for logistics and Russia won't be able to resupply its troops.

Aug 7, 2023 3:22 PM

It is specified that new Ukrainian brigades which should have been the counteroffensive’s driving force are made up of recruits, some of whom became ""mentally broken
NYT August 7. 2023

The new units of Ukraine’s armed forces that had been trained by NATO and received Western arms mostly consist of new recruits and suffer heavy losses in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, The New York Times said citing the Ukrainian military.


""I lost a lot [of troops],"" a commander of one of the units told the newspaper. ""Some of the new guys are mentally broken,"" he added. The article notes that his ""brigade had taken heavy casualties in the first days of the counteroffensive in June, when his troops ran into minefields and came under an onslaught of Russian artillery and airstrikes."" Additionally, ""for many of his troops it was their first time in battle and a brutal introduction.""

According to the newspaper, new Ukrainian brigades which should have been the counteroffensive’s driving force ""are made up of recruits, fresh from basic training after they were called up or volunteered to join the military this year."" Their commanders are mostly experienced fighters, and some have completed officer training in the United States.

The newspaper points out that in early June, the Ukrainian forces ""suffered heavy losses,"" ""struggling to advance against the formidable Russian defenses."" ""At least one new brigade was so badly debilitated from casualties that it was withdrawn from the search battlefield to rebuild,"" the article notes.

As the Russian Defense Ministry reported earlier, since June 4 the Ukrainian side has been attempting to advance without success while sustaining personnel and hardware losses. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on July 11 that Ukraine had lost more than 26,000 troops since the start of the counteroffensive. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that the Ukrainian military had failed to achieve success in any area. Putin stated at a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in St. Petersburg on July 23 that Kiev’s counteroffensive had failed.",SkyNews

I don't see why they keep talking about how Ukraine needs to show results. There are now 3-5 mines per square meter, and it's because the West dragged its feet in supplying weapons so the Russians had more time to build defenses.

“It is best for us to agree and accept the words of the Kabbalists that ‘the nature’ (Heb. ‘HaTeva’ [‘הטבע’]) has the same numerical value as ‘God’ (Heb. ‘Elohim’ [‘אלהים’]—eighty-six. Then, I will be able to call the laws of God ‘nature’s commandments [Mitzvot],’ or vice-versa (God’s commandments [Mitzvot] by the name ‘nature’s laws’), for they are one and the same.” – Kabbalist Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), “The Peace.”

There is nothing besides the system of nature, which Kabbalists equally refer to as “nature” or “God,” and we are integral parts of this system.

Therefore, when we say that there is one God, it means that there is nothing besides one force acting in this single system we are parts of.

The desire of the single force acting in reality is to bring us into connection with it—not via coercion, but through awareness in a positive manner.

As much as we understand, feel and attain this force as one that is good and benevolent, then we can adhere to it and reach its level of complete awareness.",SkyNews
